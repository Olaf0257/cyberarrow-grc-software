It can be particularly important to notify asset owners (determined during the impact analysis) and internal and external organizations (e.g. other incident response teams, law enforcement agencies, Internet service providers, and information sharing organizations) that could assist with the management and resolution of the incident. Sharing information could also benefit other organizations since the same threats and attacks often affect multiple organizations."
5,5,Responses - Post Incident Activity,"For the Responses phase, the organization should after recovery from an incident, a Post Incident Activity should be initiated depending on the nature
and severity of the incident. This activity includes:
- investigation of the information pertaining to the incident
- investigation of other relevant sources such as involved personnel
- summarized report of the investigation findings"
5,5,Responses - Close Incident,"For the Responses phase, the organization should close the incident once the incident has been resolved, according to the requirements of the IRT or parent organization and all stakeholders should be notified."
