A,5.1.1,Policies for information security,"A set of policies for information security should be defined, approved by management, published and communicated to employees and relevant external parties. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 At the highest level, organizations should define an "information security policy" which is approved by management and which sets out the organization's approach to managing its information security objectives. 
 
 Information security policies should address requirements created by: 
 a) business strategy; 
 b) regulations, legislation and contracts; 
 c) the current and projected information security threat environment. 
 
 The information security policy should contain statements concerning: 
 a) definition of information security, objectives and principles to guide all activities relating to information security; 
 b) assignment of general and specific responsibilities for information security management to defined roles; 
 c) processes for handling deviations and exceptions. 
 
 At a lower level, the information security policy should be supported by topic-specific policies, which further mandate the implementation of information security controls and are typically structured to address the needs of certain target groups within an organization or to cover certain topics. 
 a) access control; 
 b) information classification and handling; 
 c) physical and environmental security; 
 d) end user oriented topics such as: 
 1) acceptable use of assets; 
 2) clear desk and clear screen; 
 3) information transfer; 
 4) mobile devices and teleworking; 
 5) restrictions on software installations and use; 
 e) backup; 
 f) information transfer; 
 g) protection from malware;  
h) management of technical vulnerabilities; 
 i) cryptographic controls; 
 j) communications security; 
k) privacy and protection of personally identifiable information;
l) supplier relationships. 
 
 These policies should be communicated to employees and relevant external parties in a form that is relevant, accessible and understandable to the intended reader, e.g. in the context of an "information security awareness, education and training programme". 
 
 Other information 
 The need for internal policies for information security varies across organizations. Internal policies are especially useful in larger and more complex organizations where those defining and approving the expected levels of control are segregated from those implementing the controls or in situations where a policy applies to many different people or functions in the organization. Policies for information security can be issued in a single "information security policy" document or as a set of individual but related documents. 
 
 If any of the information security policies are distributed outside the organization, care should be taken not to disclose confidential information. 
 
 Some organizations use other terms for these policy documents, such as "Standards", "Directives" or "Rules".",Information security policies. 
A,5.1.2,Review of the policies for information security,"The policies for information security should be reviewed at planned intervals or if significant changes occur to ensure their continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. 
 
Implementation Guidance 
Each policy should have an owner who has approved management responsibility for the development, review and evaluation of the policies. The review should include assessing opportunities for improvement of the organization's policies and approach to managing information security in response to changes to the organizational environment, business circumstances, legal conditions or technical environment. The review of policies for information security should take the results of management reviews into account. Management approval for a revised policy should be obtained.",Evidence of review cycle followed for information security policies and procedures. 
A,6.1.1,Information security roles and responsibilities,"All information security responsibilities should be defined and allocated. 
 
Implementation Guidance 
Allocation of information security responsibilities should be done in accordance with the information security policies. Responsibilities for the protection of individual assets and for carrying out specific information security processes should be identified. Responsibilities for information security risk management activities and in particular for acceptance of residual risks should be defined. These responsibilities should be supplemented, where necessary, with more detailed guidance for specific sites and information processing facilities. Local responsibilities for the protection of assets and for carrying out specific security processes should be defined. 
 
 Individuals with allocated information security responsibilities may delegate security tasks to others. Nevertheless they remain accountable and should determine that any delegated tasks have been correctly performed. 
 
 Areas for which individuals are responsible should be stated. In particular the following should take place: 
 a) the assets and information security processes should be identified and defined; 
 b) the entity responsible for each asset or information security process should be assigned and the details of this responsibility should be documented; 
 c) authorization levels should be defined and documented; 
 d) to be able to fulfil responsibilities in the information security area the appointed individuals should be competent in the area and be given opportunities to keep up to date with developments; 
 e) coordination and oversight of information security aspects of supplier relationships should be identified and documented. 
 
 Other information 
 Many organizations appoint an information security manager to take overall responsibility for the development and implementation of information security and to support the identification of controls. 
 
 However, responsibility for resourcing and implementing the controls will often remain with individual managers. One common practice is to appoint an owner for each asset who then becomes responsible for its day-to-day protection.",Roles and responsibilities document.
A,6.1.2,Segregation of duties,"Conflicting duties and areas of responsibility should be segregated to reduce opportunities for unauthorized or unintentional modification or misuse of the organization's assets. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Care should be taken that no single person can access, modify or use assets without authorization or detection. The initiation of an event should be separated from its authorization. The possibility of collusion should be considered in designing the controls. 
 
 Small organizations may find segregation of duties difficult to achieve, but the principle should be applied as far as is possible and practicable. Whenever it is difficult to segregate, other controls such as monitoring of activities, audit trails and management supervision should be considered. 
 
 Other information 
 Segregation of duties is a method for reducing the risk of accidental or deliberate misuse of an organization's assets.",Evidence of segregation of duties in job descriptions or organization chart. 
A,6.1.3,Contact with authorities,"Appropriate contacts with relevant authorities should be maintained. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Organizations should have procedures in place that specify when and by whom authorities (e.g. law enforcement, regulatory bodies, supervisory authorities) should be contacted and how identified information security incidents should be reported in a timely manner (e.g. if it is suspected that laws may have been broken). 
 
 Other information 
 Organizations under attack from the Internet may need authorities to take action against the attack source. 
 
 Maintaining such contacts may be a requirement to support information security incident management or the business continuity and contingency planning process. Contacts with regulatory bodies are also useful to anticipate and prepare for upcoming changes in laws or regulations, which have to be implemented by the organization. Contacts with other authorities include utilities, emergency services, electricity suppliers and health and safety, e.g. fire departments (in connection with business continuity), telecommunication providers (in connection with line routing and availability) and water suppliers (in connection with cooling facilities for equipment).",Contact list for authorities.
A,6.1.4,Contact with special interest groups,"Appropriate contacts with special interest groups or other specialist security forums and professional associations should be maintained. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Membership in special interest groups or forums should be considered as a means to: 
 a) improve knowledge about best practices and stay up to date with relevant security information; 
 b) ensure the understanding of the information security environment is current and complete; 
 c) receive early warnings of alerts, advisories and patches pertaining to attacks and vulnerabilities; 
 d) gain access to specialist information security advice; 
 e) share and exchange information about new technologies, products, threats or vulnerabilities; 
 f) provide suitable liaison points when dealing with information security incidents. 
 
 Other information 
 Information sharing agreements can be established to improve cooperation and coordination of security issues. Such agreements should identify requirements for the protection of confidential information.",Contact list for special interest groups.
A,6.1.5,Information security in project management,"Information security should be addressed in project management regardless of the type of the project. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Information security should be integrated into the organization's project management method(s) to ensure that information security risks are identified and addressed as part of a project. This applies generally to any project regardless of its character, e.g. a project for a core business process, IT, facility management and other supporting processes. The project management methods in use should require that: 
 a) information security objectives are included in project objectives; 
 b) an information security risk assessment is conducted at an early stage of the project to identify necessary controls; 
 c) information security is part of all phases of the applied project methodology. 
 
 Information security implications should be addressed and reviewed regularly in all projects. Responsibilities for information security should be defined and allocated to specified roles defined in the project management methods.",Procedure for including information security in project management and sample of a project with identified information security requirements. 
A,6.2.1,Mobile Device Policy,"A policy and supporting measures should be adopted to manage the risks introduced by using mobile devices. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 When using mobile devices, special care should be taken to ensure that business information is not compromised. The mobile device policy should take into account the risks of working with mobile devices in unprotected environments. 
 
 The mobile device policy should consider: 
 a) registration of mobile devices; 
 b) requirements for physical protection; 
 c) restriction of software installation; 
 d) requirements for mobile device software versions and for applying patches; e) restriction of connection to information services; 
 e) restriction of connection to information services; 
 f) access controls; 
 g) cryptographic techniques; 
 h) malware protection; 
 i) remote disabling, erasure or lockout; 
 j) backups; 
 k) usage of web services and web apps. 
 
 Care should be taken when using mobile devices in public places, meeting rooms and other unprotected areas. Protection should be in place to avoid the unauthorized access to or disclosure of the information stored and processed by these devices, e.g. using cryptographic techniques and enforcing use of secret authentication information. 
 
 Mobile devices should also be physically protected against theft especially when left, for example, in cars and other forms of transport, hotel rooms, conference centres and meeting places. A specific procedure taking into account legal, insurance and other security requirements of the organization should be established for cases of theft or loss of mobile devices. Devices carrying important, sensitive or critical business information should not be left unattended and, where possible, should be physically locked away, or special locks should be used to secure the devices. 
 
 Training should be arranged for personnel using mobile devices to raise their awareness of the additional risks resulting from this way of working and the controls that should be implemented. 
 
 Where the mobile device policy allows the use of privately owned mobile devices, the policy and related security measures should also consider: 
 a) separation of private and business use of the devices, including using software to support such separation and protect business data on a private device; 
 b) providing access to business information only after users have signed an end user agreement acknowledging their duties (physical protection, software updating, etc.), waiving ownership of business data, allowing remote wiping of data by the organization in case of theft or loss of the device or when no longer authorized to use the service. This policy needs to take account of privacy legislation. 
 
 Other information 
 Mobile device wireless connections are similar to other types of network connection, but have important differences that should be considered when identifying controls. Typical differences are: 
 a) some wireless security protocols are immature and have known weaknesses; 
 b) information stored on mobile devices may not be backed-up because of limited network bandwidth or because mobile devices may not be connected at the times when backups are scheduled. 
 
 Mobile devices generally share common functions, e.g. networking, internet access, e-mail and file handling, with fixed use devices. Information security controls for the mobile devices generally consist of those adopted in the fixed use devices and those to address threats raised by their usage outside the organization's premises.",Mobile device policy including rules for bring your own device (BYOD).
A,6.2.2,Teleworking,"A policy and supporting security measures should be implemented to protect information accessed, processed or stored at teleworking sites. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Organizations allowing teleworking activities should issue a policy that defines the conditions and restrictions for using teleworking. Where deemed applicable and allowed by law, the following matters should be considered: 
 a) the existing physical security of the teleworking site, taking into account the physical security of the building and the local environment; 
 b) the proposed physical teleworking environment; 
 c) the communications security requirements, taking into account the need for remote access to the organization's internal systems, the sensitivity of the information that will be accessed and passed over the communication link and the sensitivity of the internal system; 
 d) the provision of virtual desktop access that prevents processing and storage of information on privately owned equipment; 
 e) the threat of unauthorized access to information or resources from other persons using the accommodation, e.g. family and friends; 
 f) the use of home networks and requirements or restrictions on the configuration of wireless network services; 
 g) policies and procedures to prevent disputes concerning rights to intellectual property developed on privately owned equipment; 
 h) access to privately owned equipment (to verify the security of the machine or during an investigation), which may be prevented by legislation; 
 i) software licensing agreements that are such that organizations may become liable for licensing for client software on workstations owned privately by employees or external party users; 
 j) malware protection and firewall requirements. 
 
 The guidelines and arrangements to be considered should include: 
 a) the provision of suitable equipment and storage furniture for the teleworking activities, where the use of privately owned equipment that is not under the control of the organization is not allowed; 
 b) a definition of the work permitted, the hours of work, the classification of information that may be held and the internal systems and services that the teleworker is authorized to access; 
 c) the provision of suitable communication equipment, including methods for securing remote access; 
 d) physical security; 
 e) rules and guidance on family and visitor access to equipment and information; 
 f) the provision of hardware and software support and maintenance; 
 g) the provision of insurance; 
 h) the procedures for backup and business continuity; 
 i) audit and security monitoring; 
 j) revocation of authority and access rights, and the return of equipment when the teleworking activities are terminated. 
 
 Other information 
 Teleworking refers to all forms of work outside of the office, including non-traditional work environments, such as those referred to as "telecommuting", "flexible workplace", "remote work" and "virtual work" environments.",Teleworking policy. 
A,7.1.1,Screening,"Background verification checks on all candidates for employment should be carried out in accordance with relevant laws, regulations and ethics and should be proportional to the business requirements, the classification of the information to be accessed and the perceived risks. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Verification should take into account all relevant privacy, protection of personally identifiable information and employment based legislation, and should, where permitted, include the following: 
 a) availability of satisfactory character references, e.g. one business and one personal; 
 b) a verification (for completeness and accuracy) of the applicant's curriculum vitae; 
 c) confirmation of claimed academic and professional qualifications; 
 d) independent identity verification (passport or similar document); 
 e) more detailed verification, such as credit review or review of criminal records. 
 
 When an individual is hired for a specific information security role, organizations should make sure the candidate: 
 a) has the necessary competence to perform the security role; 
 b) can be trusted to take on the role, especially if the role is critical for the organization. 
 
 Where a job, either on initial appointment or on promotion, involves the person having access to information processing facilities, and, in particular, if these are handling confidential information, e.g. financial information or highly confidential information, the organization should also consider further, more detailed verifications. 
 
 Procedures should define criteria and limitations for verification reviews, e.g. who is eligible to screen people and how, when and why verification reviews are carried out. 
 
 A screening process should also be ensured for contractors. In these cases, the agreement between the organization and the contractor should specify responsibilities for conducting the screening and the notification procedures that need to be followed if screening has not been completed or if the results give cause for doubt or concern. 
 
 Information on all candidates being considered for positions within the organization should be collected and handled in accordance with any appropriate legislation existing in the relevant jurisdiction. Depending on applicable legislation, the candidates should be informed beforehand about the screening activities.",Sample security screening process or form. 
A,7.1.2,Terms and conditions of employment,"The contractual agreements with employees and contractors should state their and the organization's responsibilities for information security. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The contractual obligations for employees or contractors should reflect the organization's policies for information security in addition to clarifying and stating: 
 a) that all employees and contractors who are given access to confidential information should sign a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement prior to being given access to information processing facilities; 
 b) the employee's or contractor's legal responsibilities and rights, e.g. regarding copyright laws or data protection legislation; 
 c) responsibilities for the classification of information and management of organizational information, other assets associated with information, information processing facilities and information services handled by the employee or contractor; 
 d) responsibilities of the employee or contractor for the handling of information received from other companies or external parties; 
 e) actions to be taken if the employee or contractor disregards the organization's security requirements. 
 
 Information security roles and responsibilities should be communicated to job candidates during the pre-employment process. 
 
 The organization should ensure that employees and contractors agree to terms and conditions concerning information security appropriate to the nature and extent of access they will have to the organization's assets associated with information systems and services. 
 
 Where appropriate, responsibilities contained within the terms and conditions of employment should continue for a defined period after the end of the employment. 
 
 Other information 
 A code of conduct may be used to state the employee's or contractor's information security responsibilities regarding confidentiality, data protection, ethics, appropriate use of the organization's equipment and facilities, as well as reputable practices expected by the organization. An external party, with which a contractor is associated, can be required to enter into contractual arrangements on behalf of the contracted individual.",Sample employee contract. 
A,7.2.1,Management Responsibilities,"Management should require all employees and contractors to apply information security in accordance with the established policies and procedures of the organization 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Management responsibilities should include ensuring that employees and contractors: 
 a) are properly briefed on their information security roles and responsibilities prior to being granted access to confidential information or information systems; 
 b) are provided with guidelines to state information security expectations of their role within the 10 organization; 
 c) are motivated to fulfil the information security policies of the organization; 
 d) achieve a level of awareness on information security relevant to their roles and responsibilities within the organization; 
 e) conform to the terms and conditions of employment, which includes the organization's information security policy and appropriate methods of working; 
 f) continue to have the appropriate skills and qualifications and are educated on a regular basis; 
 g) are provided with an anonymous reporting channel to report violations of information security policies or procedures ("whistle blowing"). 
 
 Management should demonstrate support of information security policies, procedures and controls, and act as a role model. 
 
 Other information 
 If employees and contractors are not made aware of their information security responsibilities, they can cause considerable damage to an organization. Motivated personnel are likely to be more reliable and cause fewer information security incidents. 
 
 Poor management can cause personnel to feel undervalued resulting in a negative information security impact on the organization. For example, poor management can lead to information security being neglected or potential misuse of the organization's assets.",Sample job description including information security responsibilities. 
A,7.2.2,"Information security awareness, education and training","All employees of the organization and, where relevant, contractors should receive appropriate awareness education and training and regular updates in organizational policies and procedures, as relevant for their job function. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 An information security awareness programme should aim to make employees and, where relevant, contractors aware of their responsibilities for information security and the means by which those responsibilities are discharged. 
 
 An information security awareness programme should be established in line with the organization's information security policies and relevant procedures, taking into consideration the organization's information to be protected and the controls that have been implemented to protect the information. The awareness programme should include a number of awareness-raising activities such as campaigns (e.g. an "information security day") and issuing booklets or newsletters. 
 
 The awareness programme should be planned taking into consideration the employees' roles in the organization, and, where relevant, the organization's expectation of the awareness of contractors. The activities in the awareness programme should be scheduled over time, preferably regularly, so that the activities are repeated and cover new employees and contractors. The awareness programme should also be updated regularly so it stays in line with organizational policies and procedures, and should be built on lessons learnt from information security incidents. 
 
 Awareness training should be performed as required by the organization's information security awareness programme. Awareness training can use different delivery media including classroom-based, distance learning, web-based, self-paced and others. 
 
 Information security education and training should also cover general aspects such as: 
 a) stating management's commitment to information security throughout the organization; 
 b) the need to become familiar with and comply with applicable information security rules and obligations, as defined in policies, standards, laws, regulations, contracts and agreements; 
 c) personal accountability for one's own actions and inactions, and general responsibilities towards securing or protecting information belonging to the organization and external parties; 
 d) basic information security procedures (such as information security incident reporting) and baseline controls (such as password security, malware controls and clear desks); 
 e) contact points and resources for additional information and advice on information security matters, including further information security education and training materials. 
 
 Information security education and training should take place periodically. Initial education and training applies to those who transfer to new positions or roles with substantially different information security requirements, not just to new starters and should take place before the role becomes active. 
 
 The organization should develop the education and training programme in order to conduct the education and training effectively. The programme should be in line with the organization's information security policies and relevant procedures, taking into consideration the organization's information to be protected and the controls that have been implemented to protect the information. The programme should consider different forms of education and training, e.g. lectures or self-studies. 
 
 Other information 
 When composing an awareness programme, it is important not only to focus on the 'what' and 'how', but also the 'why'. It is important that employees understand the aim of information security and the potential impact, positive and negative, on the organization of their own behavior. 
 
 Awareness, education and training can be part of, or conducted in collaboration with, other training activities, for example general IT or general security training. Awareness, education and training activities should be suitable and relevant to the individual's roles, responsibilities and skills. 
 
 An assessment of the employees' understanding could be conducted at the end of an awareness, education and training course to test knowledge transfer.",Training plans and training evaluation reports. Information security awareness campaign plan and evidence of any awareness content sent to staff. 
A,7.2.3,Disciplinary Process,"There should be a formal and communicated disciplinary process in place to take action against employees who have committed an information security breach. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The disciplinary process should not be commenced without prior verification that an information security breach has occurred. 
 
 The formal disciplinary process should ensure correct and fair treatment for employees who are suspected of committing breaches of information security. The formal disciplinary process should provide for a graduated response that takes into consideration factors such as the nature and gravity of the breach and its impact on business, whether or not this is a first or repeat offence, whether or not the violator was properly trained, relevant legislation, business contracts and other factors as required. 
 
 The disciplinary process should also be used as a deterrent to prevent employees from violating the organization's information security policies and procedures and any other information security breaches. Deliberate breaches may require immediate actions. 
 
 Other information 
 The disciplinary process can also become a motivation or an incentive if positive sanctions are defined for remarkable behavior with regards to information security.",Disciplinary process for information security violations. 
A,7.3.1,Termination of change of employment responsibilities,"Information security responsibilities and duties that remain valid after termination or change of employment should be defined, communicated to the employee or contractor and enforced. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The communication of termination responsibilities should include on-going information security requirements and legal responsibilities and, where appropriate, responsibilities contained within any confidentiality agreement and the terms and conditions of employment continuing for a defined period after the end of the employee's or contractor's employment. 
 
 Responsibilities and duties still valid after termination of employment should be contained in the employee's or contractor's terms and conditions of employment. 
 
 Changes of responsibility or employment should be managed as the termination of the current responsibility or employment combined with the initiation of the new responsibility or employment. 
 
 Other information 
 The human resources function is generally responsible for the overall termination process and works together with the supervising manager of the person leaving to manage the information security aspects of the relevant procedures. In the case of a contractor provided through an external party, this termination process is undertaken by the external party in accordance with the contract between the organization and the external party. 
 
 It may be necessary to inform employees, customers or contractors of changes to personnel and operating arrangements.",Procedure for exit interviews and evidence of discussing information security responsibilities at termination or change of employment. 
A,8.1.1,Inventory of assets,"Information, other assets associated with information and information processing facilities should be identified and an inventory of these assets should be drawn up and maintained. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 An organization should identify assets relevant in the lifecycle of information and document their importance. The lifecycle of information should include creation, processing, storage, transmission, deletion and destruction. Documentation should be maintained in dedicated or existing inventories as appropriate. 
 
 The asset inventory should be accurate, up to date, consistent and aligned with other inventories. 
 
 For each of the identified assets, ownership of the asset should be assigned and the classification should be identified. 
 
 Other Information 
 Inventories of assets help to ensure that effective protection takes place, and may also be required for other purposes, such as health and safety, insurance or financial (asset management) reasons. 
 
 ISO/IEC 27005[11] provides examples of assets that might need to be considered by the organization when identifying assets. The process of compiling an inventory of assets is an important prerequisite of risk management (see also ISO/IEC 27000 and ISO/IEC 27005[11]).",Asset inventory including asset criticality.
A,8.1.2,Ownership of assets,"Assets maintained in the inventory should be owned. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Individuals as well as other entities having approved management responsibility for the asset lifecycle qualify to be assigned as asset owners. 
 
 A process to ensure timely assignment of asset ownership is usually implemented. Ownership should be assigned when assets are created or when assets are transferred to the organization. The asset owner should be responsible for the proper management of an asset over the whole asset lifecycle. 
 
 The asset owner should: 
 a) ensure that assets are inventoried; 
 b) ensure that assets are appropriately classified and protected; 
 c) define and periodically review access restrictions and classifications to important assets, taking into account applicable access control policies; 
 d) ensure proper handling when the asset is deleted or destroyed. 
 
 Other information 
 The identified owner can be either an individual or an entity who has approved management responsibility for controlling the whole lifecycle of an asset. The identified owner does not necessarily have any property rights to the asset. 
 
 Routine tasks may be delegated, e.g. to a custodian looking after the assets on a daily basis, but the responsibility remains with the owner. 
 
 In complex information systems, it may be useful to designate groups of assets which act together to provide a particular service. In this case the owner of this service is accountable for the delivery of the service, including the operation of its assets.",Asset inventory including asset owners. 
A,8.1.3,Acceptable use of assets,"Rules for the acceptable use of information and of assets associated with information and information processing facilities should be identified, documented and implemented. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Employees and external party users using or having access to the organization's assets should be made aware of the information security requirements of the organization's information, other assets associated with information and information processing facilities and resources.",Acceptable use policy.
A,8.1.4,Return of assets,"All employees and external party users should return all of the organizational assets in their possession upon termination of their employment, contract or agreement. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The termination process should be formalized to include the return of all previously issued physical and electronic assets owned by or entrusted to the organization. 
 
 In cases where an employee or external party users purchases the organization's equipment or uses their own personal equipment, procedures should be followed to ensure that all relevant information is transferred to the organization and securely erased from the equipment. 
 
 In cases where an employee or eternal party user has knowledge that is important to ongoing operations, that information should be documented and transferred to the organization. 
 
 During the notice period of termination, the organization should control unauthorized copying of relevant information (e.g. intellectual property) by terminated employees and contractors.",Exit or clearance forms for returning assets after resignation or termination of contract. 
A,8.2.1,Classification of information,"Information should be classified in terms of legal requirements, value, criticality, and sensitivity to unauthorized disclosure or modification. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Classifications and associated protective controls for information should take account of business needs for sharing or restricting information, as well as legal requirements. Assets other than information can also be classified in conformance with classification of information which is stored in, processed by or otherwise handled or protected by the asset. 
 
 Owners of information assets should be accountable for their classification. 
 
 The classification scheme should include conventions for classification and criteria for review of the classification over time. The level of protection in the scheme should be assessed by analysing confidentiality, integrity and availability and any other requirements for the information considered. The scheme should be aligned to the access control policy. 
 
 Each level should be given a name that makes sense in the context of the classification scheme's application. 
 
 The scheme should be consistent across the whole organization so that everyone will classify information and related assets in the same way, have a common understanding of protection requirements and apply the appropriate protection. 
 
 Classification should be included in the organization's processes, and be consistent and coherent across the organization. Results of classification should indicate value of assets depending on their sensitivity and criticality to the organization, e.g. in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Results of classification should be updated in accordance with changes of their value, sensitivity and criticality through their life-cycle. 
 
 Other information 
 Classification provides people who deal with information with a concise indication of how to handle and protect it. Creating groups of information with similar protection needs and specifying information security procedures that apply to all the information in each group facilitates this. This approach reduces the need for case-by-case risk assessment and custom design of controls. 
 
 Information can cease to be sensitive or critical after a certain period of time, for example, when the information has been made public. These aspects should be taken into account, as over-classification can lead to the implementation of unnecessary controls resulting in additional expense or on the contrary under-classification can endanger the achievement of business objectives. 
 
 An example of an information confidentiality classification scheme could be based on four levels as follows: 
 a) disclosure causes no harm; 
 b) disclosure causes minor embarrassment or minor operational inconvenience; 
 c) disclosure has a significant short term impact on operations or tactical objectives; 
 d) disclosure has a serious impact on long term strategic objectives or puts the survival of the organization at risk.",Controls and policy for information classification. 
A,8.2.2,Labeling of information,"An appropriate set of procedures for information labeling should be developed and implemented in accordance with the information classification scheme adopted by the organization. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Procedures for information labelling need to cover information and its related assets in physical and electronic formats. The labelling should reflect the classification scheme established in the organization. The labels should be easily recognizable. The procedures should give guidance on where and how labels are attached in consideration of how the information is accessed or the assets are handled depending on the types of media. The procedures can define cases where labelling is omitted, e.g. labelling of non- confidential information to reduce workloads. Employees and contractors should be made aware of labelling procedures. 
 
 Output from systems containing information that is classified as being sensitive or critical should carry an appropriate classification label. 
 
 Other Information 
 Labelling of classified information is a key requirement for information sharing arrangements. Physical labels and metadata are a common form of labelling. 
 
 Labelling of information and its related assets can sometimes have negative effects. Classified assets are easier to identify and accordingly to steal by insiders or external attackers.",Controls for labeling information.
A,8.2.3,Handling of assets,"Procedures for handling assets should be developed and implemented in accordance with the information classification scheme adopted by the organization. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Procedures should be drawn up for handling, processing, storing, and communicating information consistent with its classification. 
 
 The following items should be considered: 
 a) access restrictions supporting the protection requirements for each level of classification; 
 b) maintenance of a formal record of the authorized recipients of assets; 
 c) protection of temporary or permanent copies of information to a level consistent with the protection of the original information; 
 d) storage of IT assets in accordance with manufacturers' specifications; 
 e) clear marking of all copies of media for the attention of the authorized recipient. 
 
 The classification scheme used within the organization may not be equivalent to the schemes used by other organizations, even if the names for levels are similar; in addition, information moving between organizations can vary in classification depending on its context in each organization, even if their classification schemes are identical. 
 
 Agreements with other organizations that include information sharing should include procedures to identify the classification of that information and to interpret the classification labels from other organizations.",Procedure for handling assets based on classification label.
A,8.3.1,Management of removable media,"Procedures should be implemented for the management of removable media in accordance with the classification scheme adopted by the organization. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The following guidelines for the management of removable media should be considered: 
 a) if no longer required, the contents of any re-usable media that are to be removed from the organization should be made unrecoverable; 
 b) where necessary and practical, authorization should be required for media removed from the organization and a record of such removals should be kept in order to maintain an audit trail; 
 c) all media should be stored in a safe, secure environment, in accordance with manufacturers' specifications; 
 d) if data confidentiality or integrity are important considerations, cryptographic techniques should be used to protect data on removable media; 
 e) to mitigate the risk of media degrading while stored data are still needed, the data should be transferred to fresh media before becoming unreadable; 
 f) multiple copies of valuable data should be stored on separate media to further reduce the risk of coincidental data damage or loss; 
 g) registration of removable media should be considered to limit the opportunity for data loss; 
 h) removable media drives should only be enabled if there is a business reason for doing so; 
 i) where there is a need to use removable media the transfer of information to such media should be monitored. 
 
 Procedures and authorization levels should be documented.",Policy for use of removable media or USB in the organization. 
A,8.3.2,Disposal of media,"Media should be disposed of securely when no longer required, using formal procedures. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Formal procedures for the secure disposal of media should be established to minimize the risk of confidential information leakage to unauthorized persons. The procedures for secure disposal of media containing confidential information should be proportional to the sensitivity of that information. The following items should be considered: 
 
 a) media containing confidential information should be stored and disposed of securely, e.g. by incineration or shredding, or erasure of data for use by another application within the organization; 
 b) procedures should be in place to identify the items that might require secure disposal; 
 c) it may be easier to arrange for all media items to be collected and disposed of securely, rather than attempting to separate out the sensitive items; 
 d) many organizations offer collection and disposal services for media; care should be taken in selecting a suitable external party with adequate controls and experience; 
 e) disposal of sensitive items should be logged in order to maintain an audit trail. 
 
 When accumulating media for disposal, consideration should be given to the aggregation effect, which can cause a large quantity of non-sensitive information to become sensitive. 
 
 Other information 
 Damaged devices containing sensitive data may require a risk assessment to determine whether the items should be physically destroyed rather than sent for repair or discarded.",Sample report of secure disposal of media. 
A,8.3.3,Physical media transfer,"Media containing information should be protected against unauthorized access, misuse or corruption during transportation. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The following guidelines should be considered to protect media containing information being transported: 
 a) reliable transport or couriers should be used; 
 b) a list of authorized couriers should be agreed with management; 
 c) procedures to verify the identification of couriers should be developed; 
 d) packaging should be sufficient to protect the contents from any physical damage likely to arise during transit and in accordance with any manufacturers' specifications, for example protecting against any environmental factors that may reduce the media's restoration effectiveness such as exposure to heat, moisture or electromagnetic fields; 
 e) logs should be kept, identifying the content of the media, the protection applied as well as recording the times of transfer to the transit custodians and receipt at the destination. 
 
 Other information 
 Information can be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse or corruption during physical transport, for instance when sending media via the postal service or via courier. In this control, media include paper documents. 
 
 When confidential information on media is not encrypted, additional physical protection of the media should be considered.",Form or process for physical transfer of media.
A,9.1.1,Access control policy,"An access control policy should be established, documented and reviewed based on business and information security requirements. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Asset owners should determine appropriate access control rules, access rights and restrictions for specific user roles towards their assets, with the amount of detail and the strictness of the controls reflecting the associated information security risks. 
 
 Access controls are both logical and physical and these should be considered together. Users and service providers should be given a clear statement of the business requirements to be met by access controls. 
 
 The policy should take account of the following: 
 a) security requirements of business applications; 
 b) policies for information dissemination and authorization, e.g. the need-to-know principle and information security levels and classification of information; 
 c) consistency between the access rights and information classification policies of systems and networks; 
 d) relevant legislation and any contractual obligations regarding limitation of access to data or services; 
 e) management of access rights in a distributed and networked environment which recognizes all types of connections available; 
 f) segregation of access control roles, e.g. access request, access authorization, access administration; 
 g) requirements for formal authorization of access requests; 
 h) requirements for periodic review of access rights; 
 i) removal of access rights; 
 j) archiving of records of all significant events concerning the use and management of user identities and secret authentication information; 
 k) roles with privileged access. 
 
 Other information 
 Care should be taken when specifying access control rules to consider: 
 a) establishingrulesbasedonthepremise"Everythingisgenerallyforbiddenunlessexpresslypermitted" rather than the weaker rule "Everything is generally permitted unless expressly forbidden"; 
 b) changes in information labels that are initiated automatically by information processing facilities and those initiated at the discretion of a user; 
 c) changes in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and those initiated by an administrator; 
 d) rules which require specific approval before enactment and those which do not. 
 
 Access control rules should be supported by formal procedures and defined responsibilities. 
 
 Role based access control is an approach used successfully by many organisations to link access rights with business roles. 
 
 Two of the frequent principles directing the access control policy are: 
 a) Need-to-know: you are only granted access to the information you need to perform your tasks (different tasks/roles mean different need-to-know and hence different access profile); 
 b) Need-to-use: you are only granted access to the information processing facilities (IT equipment, applications, procedures, rooms) you need to perform your task/job/role.",Access control policy.
A,9.1.2,Access to networks and network services,"Users should only be provided with access to the network and network services that they have been specifically authorized to use. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 A policy should be formulated concerning the use of networks and network services. This policy should cover: 
 a) the networks and network services which are allowed to be accessed; 
 b) authorization procedures for determining who is allowed to access which networks and networked services; 
 c) management controls and procedures to protect access to network connections and network services; 
 d) the means used to access networks and network services (e.g. use of VPN or wireless network); 
 e) user authentication requirements for accessing various network services; 
 f) monitoring of the use of network services. 
 
 The policy on the use of network services should be consistent with the organization's access control policy. 
 
 Other information 
 Unauthorized and insecure connections to network services can affect the whole organization. This control is particularly important for network connections to sensitive or critical business applications or to users in high-risk locations, e.g. public or external areas that are outside the organization's information security management and control.",Controls for controlling access to network or network services including wireless network such as using network access controls or VPN.
A,9.2.1,User registration and de-registration,"A formal user registration and de-registration process should be implemented to enable assignment of access rights. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The process for managing user IDs should include: 
 a) using unique user IDs to enable users to be linked to and held responsible for their actions; the use of shared IDs should only be permitted where they are necessary for business or operational reasons and should be approved and documented; 
 b) immediately disabling or removing user IDs of users who have left the organization; 
 c) periodically identifying and removing or disabling redundant user IDs; 
 d) ensuring that redundant user IDs are not issued to other users. 
 
 Other information 
 Providing or revoking access to information or information processing facilities is usually a two- step procedure: 
 a) assigning and enabling, or revoking, a user ID; 
 b) providing, or revoking, access rights to such user ID.",User registration and de-registration procedure.
A,9.2.2,User access provisioning,"A formal user access provisioning process should be implemented to assign or revoke access rights for all user types to all systems and services. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The provisioning process for assigning or revoking access rights granted to user IDs should include: 
 a) obtaining authorization from the owner of the information system or service for the use of the information system or service; separate approval for access rights from management may also be appropriate; 
b) verifying that the level of access granted is appropriate to the access policies and is consistent with other requirements such as segregation of duties; 
c) ensuring that access rights are not activated (e.g. by service providers) before authorization procedures are completed; 
d) maintaining a central record of access rights granted to a user ID to access information systems and services; 
e) adapting access rights of users who have changed roles or jobs and immediately removing or blocking access rights of users who have left the organization;
f) periodically reviewing access rights with owners of the information systems or services. 
 
 Other information 
 Consideration should be given to establishing user access roles based on business requirements that summarize a number of access rights into typical user access profiles. Access requests and reviews are easier managed at the level of such roles than at the level of particular rights. 
 
 Consideration should be given to including clauses in personnel contracts and service contracts that specify sanctions if unauthorized access is attempted by personnel or contractors.",Sample of access provisioning request showing the process for providing access to users. 
A,9.2.3,Management of privileged access rights,"The allocation and use of privileged access rights should be restricted and controlled. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The allocation of privileged access rights should be controlled through a formal authorization process in accordance with the relevant access control policy. 
The following steps should be considered: 
 a) the privileged access rights associated with each system or process, e.g. operating system, database management system and each application and the users to whom they need to be allocated should be identified; 
 b) privileged access rights should be allocated to users on a need-to-use basis and on an event-by- event basis in line with the access control policy , i.e. based on the minimum requirement for their functional roles; 
 c) an authorization process and a record of all privileges allocated should be maintained. Privileged access rights should not be granted until the authorization process is complete; 
 d) requirements for expiry of privileged access rights should be defined; 
 e) privileged access rights should be assigned to a user ID different from those used for regular business activities. Regular business activities should not be performed from privileged ID; 
 f) the competences of users with privileged access rights should be reviewed regularly in order to verify if they are in line with their duties; 
 g) specific procedures should be established and maintained in order to avoid the unauthorized use of generic administration user IDs, according to systems' configuration capabilities; 
 h) for generic administration user IDs, the confidentiality of secret authentication information should be maintained when shared (e.g. changing passwords frequently and as soon as possible when a privileged user leaves or changes job, communicating them among privileged users with appropriate mechanisms). 
 
 Other information 
 Inappropriate use of system administration privileges (any feature or facility of an information system that enables the user to override system or application controls) is a major contributory factor to failures or breaches of systems.",Privileged access rights policy.
A,9.2.4,Management of secret authentication information of users,"The allocation of secret authentication information should be controlled through a formal management process. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The process should include the following requirements: 
 a) users should be required to sign a statement to keep personal secret authentication information confidential and to keep group (i.e. shared) secret authentication information solely within the members of the group; this signed statement may be included in the terms and conditions of employment; 
 b) when users are required to maintain their own secret authentication information they should be provided initially with secure temporary secret authentication information, which they are forced to change on first use; 
 c) procedures should be established to verify the identity of a user prior to providing new, replacement or temporary secret authentication information; 
 d) temporary secret authentication information should be given to users in a secure manner; the use of external parties or unprotected (clear text) electronic mail messages should be avoided; 
 e) temporary secret authentication information should be unique to an individual and should not be guessable; 
 f) users should acknowledge receipt of secret authentication information; 
 g) default vendor secret authentication information should be altered following installation of systems or software. 
 
 Other information 
 Passwords are a commonly used type of secret authentication information and are a common means of verifying a user's identity. Other types of secret authentication information are cryptographic keys and other data stored on hardware tokens (e.g. smart cards) that produce authentication codes.",Password policy.
A,9.2.5,Review of user access rights,"Asset owners should review users' access rights at regular intervals. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The review of access rights should consider the following: 
a) users' access rights should be reviewed at regular interval) users' access rights should be reviewed at regular intervals and after any changes, such as promotion, demotion or termination of employment; 
b) user access rights should be reviewed and re-allocated when moving from one role to another within the same organization; 
c) authorizations for privileged access rights should be reviewed at more frequent intervals; 
d) privilege allocations should be checked at regular intervals to ensure that unauthorized privileges have not been obtained; 
e) changes to privileged accounts should be logged for periodic review. 
 ",Report of review of access rights including logical and physical access. 
A,9.2.6,Removal or adjustment of access rights,"The access rights of all employees and external party users to information and information processing facilities should be removed upon termination of their employment, contract or agreement, or adjusted upon change. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Upon termination, the access rights of an individual to information and assets associated with information processing facilities and services should be removed or suspended. This will determine whether it is necessary to remove access rights. Changes of employment should be reflected in removal of all access rights that were not approved for the new employment. The access rights that should be removed or adjusted include those of physical and logical access. Removal or adjustment can be done by removal, revocation or replacement of keys, identification cards, information processing facilities or subscriptions. Any documentation that identifies access rights of employees and contractors should reflect the removal or adjustment of access rights. If a departing employee or external party user has known passwords for user IDs remaining active, these should be changed upon termination or change of employment, contract or agreement. 
 
 Access rights for information and assets associated with information processing facilities should be reduced or removed before the employment terminates or changes, depending on the evaluation of risk factors such as: 
 a) whether the termination or change is initiated by the employee, the external party user or by management, and the reason for termination; 
 b) the current responsibilities of the employee, external party user or any other user; c) the value of the assets currently accessible. 
 
 Other information 
 In certain circumstances access rights may be allocated on the basis of being available to more people than the departing employee or external party user, e.g. group IDs. In such circumstances, departing individuals should be removed from any group access lists and arrangements should be made to advise all other employees and external party users involved to no longer share this information with the person departing. 
 
 In cases of management-initiated termination, disgruntled employees or external party users can deliberately corrupt information or sabotage information processing facilities. In cases of persons resigning or being dismissed, they may be tempted to collect information for future use.",Sample of access removal request showing the process for removing or adjusting access. 
A,9.3.1,Use of secret authentication information,"Users should be required to follow the organization's practices in the use of secret authentication information. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 All users should be advised to: 
 a) keep secret authentication) keep secret authentication information confidential, ensuring that it is not divulged to any other parties, including people of authority; 
 b) avoid keeping a record (e.g. on paper, software file or hand-held device) of secret authentication information, unless this can be stored securely and the method of storing has been approved (e.g. 24 password vault); 
 c) change secret authentication information whenever there is any indication of its possible compromise; 
 d) when passwords are used as secret authentication information, select quality passwords with sufficient minimum length which are: 
 1) easy to remember; 
 2) not based on anything somebody else could easily guess or obtain using person related information, e.g. names, telephone numbers and dates of birth etc.; 
 3) not vulnerable to dictionary attacks (i.e. do not consist of words included in dictionaries); 
 4) free of consecutive identical, all-numeric or all-alphabetic characters; 
 5) if temporary, changed at the first log-on; 
 e) not share individual user's secret authentication information; 
 f) ensure proper protection of passwords when passwords are used as secret authentication information in automated log-on procedures and are stored; 
 g) not use the same secret authentication information for business and non-business purposes. 
 
 Other information 
 Provision of Single Sign On (SSO) or other secret authentication information management tools reduces the amount of secret authentication information that users are required to protect and thus can increase the effectiveness of this control. However, these tools can also increase the impact of disclosure of secret authentication information.",Password policy and evidence of using any multi-factor authentication or Single Sign On (SSO). 
A,9.4.1,Information access restriction,"Access to information and application system functions should be restricted in accordance with the access control policy. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Restrictions to access should be based on individual business application requirements and in accordance with the defined access control policy. 
 
 The following should be considered in order to support access restriction requirements: 
 a) providing menus to control access to application system functions; 
 b) controlling which data can be accessed by a particular user; 
 c) controlling the access rights of users, e.g. read, write, delete and execute; 
 d) controlling the access rights of other applications; 
 e) limiting the information contained in outputs; 
 f) providing physical or logical access controls for the isolation of sensitive applications, application data, or systems.",Access control policy.
A,9.4.2,Secure log-on procedures,"Where required by the access control policy, access to systems and applications should be controlled by a secure log-on procedure. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Where strong authentication and identity verification is required, authentication methods alternative to passwords, such as cryptographic means, smart cards, tokens or biometric means, should be used. 
 
 The procedure for logging into a system or application should be designed to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access. The log-on procedure should therefore disclose the minimum of information about the system or application, in order to avoid providing an unauthorized user with any unnecessary assistance. A good log-on procedure should: 
a) not display system or application identifiers until the log-on process has been successfully completed; 
b) display a general notice warning that the computer should only be accessed by authorized users; 
c) not provide help messages during the log-on procedure that would aid an unauthorized user; 
d) validate the log-on information only on completion of all input data. If an error condition arises, the system should not indicate which part of the data is correct or incorrect; 
e) protect against brute force log-on attempts; 
f) log unsuccessful and successful attempts; 
g) raise a security event if a potential attempted or successful breach of log-on controls is detected; h) display the following information on completion of a successful log-on: 
 1) date and time of the previous successful log-on; 
 2) details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last successful log-on; 
i) not display a password being entered; 
j) not transmit passwords in clear text over a network; 
k) terminate inactive sessions after a defined period of inactivity, especially in high risk locations such as public or external areas outside the organization's security management or on mobile devices; 
l) restrict connection times to provide additional security for high-risk applications and reduce the window of opportunity for unauthorized access. 
 
 Other information 
 Passwords are a common way to provide identification and authentication based on a secret that only the user knows. The same can also be achieved with cryptographic means and authentication protocols. The strength of user authentication should be appropriate for the classification of the information to be accessed. 
 
 If passwords are transmitted in clear text during the log-on session over a network, they can be captured by a network "sniffer" program.",Warning banner on systems and password policy.
A,9.4.3,Password management system,"Password management systems should be interactive and shall ensure quality passwords. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 A password management system should: 
 a) enforce the use of individual user IDs and passwords to maintain accountability; 
 b) allow users to select and change their own passwords and include a confirmation procedure to allow for input errors; 
 c) enforce a choice of quality passwords; 
 d) force users to change their passwords at the first log-on; 
 e) enforce regular password changes and as needed; 
 f) maintain a record of previously used passwords and prevent re-use; 
 g) not display passwords on the screen when being entered; 
 h) store password files separately from application system data; 
 i) store and transmit passwords in protected form.

 g) defining and documenting of authorization levels for utility programs; 
 h) removal or disabling of all unnecessary utility programs; 
 i) not making utility programs available to users who have access to applications on systems where segregation of duties is required. 
 
 Other information 
 Most computer installations have one or more utility programs that might be capable of overriding system and application controls.",List of approved utility programs. 
A,9.4.5,Access control to program source code,"Access to program source code should be restricted. 
 
Implementation Guidance 
Access to program source code and associated items (such as designs, specifications, verification plans and validation plans) should be strictly controlled, in order to prevent the introduction of unauthorized functionality and to avoid unintentional changes as well as to maintain the confidentiality of valuable intellectual property. For program source code, this can be achieved by controlled central storage of such code, preferably in program source libraries. The following guidelines should then be considered to control access to such program source libraries in order to reduce the potential for corruption of computer programs: 
 a) where possible, program source libraries should not be held in operational systems; 
 b) the program source code and the program source libraries should be managed according to established procedures; 
 c) support personnel should not have unrestricted access to program source libraries; 
 d) the updating of program source libraries and associated items and the issuing of program sources to programmers should only be performed after appropriate authorization has been received; 
 e) program listings should be held in a secure environment; 
 f) an audit log should be maintained of all accesses to program source libraries; 
 g) maintenance and copying of program source libraries should be subject to strict change control procedures. 
 
 If the program source code is intended to be published, additional controls to help getting assurance on its integrity (e.g. digital signature) should be considered.",Evidence of implementing access control to access program source code. 
A,10.1.1,Policy on the use of cryptographic controls,"A policy on the use of cryptographic controls for protection of information should be developed and implemented. 
 
Implementation Guidance 
When developing a cryptographic policy the following should be considered: 
a) the management approach towards the use of cryptographic controls across the organization, including the general principles under which business information should be protected; 
b) based on a risk assessment, the required level of protection should be identified taking into account the type, strength and quality of the encryption algorithm required; 
c) the use of encryption for protection of information transported by mobile or removable media devices or across communication lines; 
d) the approach to key management, including methods to deal with the protection of cryptographic keys and the recovery of encrypted information in the case of lost, compromised or damaged keys; 
e) roles and responsibilities, e.g. who is responsible for: 
 1) the implementation of the policy; 
 2) the key management, including key generation; 
f) the standards to be adopted for effective implementation throughout the organization (which solution is used for which business processes); 
g) the impact of using encrypted information on controls that rely upon content inspection (e.g. malware detection). 
 
When implementing the organization's cryptographic policy, consideration should be given to the regulations and national restrictions that might apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in different parts of the world and to the issues of trans-border flow of encrypted information. 
 
 Cryptographic controls can be used to achieve different information security objectives, e.g.: 
a) confidentiality: using encryption of information to protect sensitive or critical information, either stored or transmitted; 
b) integrity/authenticity: using digital signatures or message authentication codes to verify the authenticity or integrity of stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information; 
c) non-repudiation: using cryptographic techniques to provide evidence of the occurrence or non- occurrence of an event or action; 
d) authentication: using cryptographic techniques to authenticate users and other system entities requesting access to or transacting with system users, entities and resources. 
 
Other information 
Making a decision as to whether a cryptographic solution is appropriate should be seen as part of the wider process of risk assessment and selection of controls. This assessment can then be used to determine whether a cryptographic control is appropriate, what type of control should be applied and for what purpose and business processes. 
 
 A policy on the use of cryptographic controls is necessary to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of using cryptographic techniques and to avoid inappropriate or incorrect use. Specialist advice should be sought in selecting appropriate cryptographic controls to meet the information security policy objectives.",Cryptographic controls used. 
A,10.1.2,Key Management,"A policy on the use, protection and lifetime of cryptographic keys should be developed and implemented through their whole lifecycle. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 The policy should include requirements for managing cryptographic keys though their whole lifecycle including generating, storing, archiving, retrieving, distributing, retiring and destroying keys. 
 
 Cryptographic algorithms, key lengths and usage practices should be selected according to best practice. Appropriate key management requires secure processes for generating, storing, archiving, retrieving, distributing, retiring and destroying cryptographic keys. 
 
 All cryptographic keys should be protected against modification and loss. In addition, secret and private keys need protection against unauthorized use as well as disclosure. Equipment used to generate, store and archive keys should be physically protected. 
 
 A key management system should be based on an agreed set of standards, procedures and secure methods for: 
 a) generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications; 
 b) issuing and obtaining public key certificates; 
 c) distributing keys to intended entities, including how keys should be activated when received; 
 d) storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys; 
 e) changing or updating keys including rules on when keys should be changed and how this will be done; 
 f) dealing with compromised keys; 
 g) revoking keys including how keys should be withdrawn or deactivated, e.g. when keys have been compromised or when a user leaves an organization (in which case keys should also be archived); 
 h) recovering keys that are lost or corrupted; 
 i) backing up or archiving keys; 
 j) destroying keys; 
 k) logging and auditing of key management related activities. 
 
 In order to reduce the likelihood of improper use, activation and deactivation dates for keys should be defined so that the keys can only be used for the period of time defined in the associated key management policy. 
 
 In addition to securely managing secret and private keys, the authenticity of public keys should also be considered. This authentication process can be done using public key certificates, which are normally issued by a certification authority, which should be a recognized organization with suitable controls and procedures in place to provide the required degree of trust. 
 
 The contents of service level agreements or contracts with external suppliers of cryptographic services, e.g. with a certification authority, should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and response times for the provision of services. 
 
Other information 
The management of cryptographic keys is essential to the effective use of cryptographic techniques. ISO/IEC 11770[2][3][4] provides further information on key management. Cryptographic techniques can also be used to protect cryptographic keys. Procedures may need to be considered for handling legal requests for access to cryptographic keys, e.g. encrypted information can be required to be made available in an unencrypted form as evidence in a court case.",Controls for protecting cryptographic keys. 
A,11.1.1,Physical security perimeter,"Security perimeters should be defined and used to protect areas that contain either sensitive or critical information and information processing facilities. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 The following guidelines should be considered and implemented where appropriate for physical security perimeters: 
 a) security perimeters should be defined, and the siting and strength of each of the perimeters should depend on the security requirements of the assets within the perimeter and the results of a risk assessment; 
 b) perimeters of a building or site containing information processing facilities should be physically sound (i.e. there should be no gaps in the perimeter or areas where a break-in could easily occur); the exterior roof, walls and flooring of the site should be of solid construction and all external doors should be suitably protected against unauthorized access with control mechanisms, (e.g. bars, alarms, locks); doors and windows should be locked when unattended and external protection should be considered for windows, particularly at ground level; 
 c) a manned reception area or other means to control physical access to the site or building should be in place; access to sites and buildings should be restricted to authorized personnel only; 
 d) physical barriers should, where applicable, be built to prevent unauthorized physical access and environmental contamination; 
 e) all fire doors on a security perimeter should be alarmed, monitored and tested in conjunction with the walls to establish the required level of resistance in accordance with suitable regional, national and international standards; they should operate in accordance with the local fire code in a failsafe manner; 
 f) suitable intruder detection systems should be installed to national, regional or international standards and regularly tested to cover all external doors and accessible windows; unoccupied areas should be alarmed at all times; cover should also be provided for other areas, e.g. computer room or communications rooms; 
 g) information processing facilities managed by the organization should be physically separated from those managed by external parties. 
 
 Other information 
 Physical protection can be achieved by creating one or more physical barriers around the organization's premises and information processing facilities. The use of multiple barriers gives additional protection, where the failure of a single barrier does not mean that security is immediately compromised. 
 
 A secure area may be a lockable office or several rooms surrounded by a continuous internal physical security barrier. Additional barriers and perimeters to control physical access may be needed between areas with different security requirements inside the security perimeter. Special attention to physical access security should be given in the case of buildings holding assets for multiple organizations.

 The use of any information storing and processing equipment outside the organization's premises should be authorized by management. This applies to equipment owned by the organization and that equipment owned privately and used on behalf of the organization. 
 
 The following guidelines should be considered for the protection of off-site equipment: 
 a) equipment and media taken off premises should not be left unattended in public places; 
 b) manufacturers' instructions for protecting equipment should be observed at all times, e.g. protection against exposure to strong electromagnetic fields; 
 c) controls for off-premises locations, such as home-working, teleworking and temporary sites should be determined by a risk assessment and suitable controls applied as appropriate, e.g. lockable filing cabinets, clear desk policy, access controls for computers and secure communication with the office (see also ISO/IEC 27033[15][16][17][18][19]); 
 d) when off-premises equipment is transferred among different individuals or external parties, a log should be maintained that defines the chain of custody for the equipment including at least names and organizations of those who are responsible for the equipment. 
 
 Risks, e.g. of damage, theft or eavesdropping, may vary considerably between locations and should be taken into account in determining the most appropriate controls. 
 
 Other information 
 Information storing and processing equipment includes all forms of personal computers, organizers, mobile phones, smart cards, paper or other form, which is held for home working or being transported away from the normal work location.

A,11.2.7,Secure disposal or re-use of equipment,"All items of equipment containing storage media should be verified to ensure that any sensitive data and licensed software has been removed or securely overwritten prior to disposal or re-use. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 Equipment should be verified to ensure whether or not storage media is contained prior to disposal or re-use. 
 
 Storage media containing confidential or copyrighted information should be physically destroyed or the information should be destroyed, deleted or overwritten using techniques to make the original information non-retrievable rather than using the standard delete or format function. 
 
 Other information 
 Damaged equipment containing storage media may require a risk assessment to determine whether the items should be physically destroyed rather than sent for repair or discarded. Information can be compromised through careless disposal or re-use of equipment. 
 
 In addition to secure disk erasure, whole-disk encryption reduces the risk of disclosure of confidential information when equipment is disposed of or redeployed, provided that: 
 a) the encryption process is sufficiently strong and covers the entire disk (including slack space, swap files, etc.); 
 b) the encryption keys are long enough to resist brute force attacks; 
 c) the encryption keys are themselves kept confidential (e.g. never stored on the same disk). For further advice on encryption. 
 
 Techniques for securely overwriting storage media differ according to the storage media technology. Overwriting tools should be reviewed to make sure that they are applicable to the technology of the storage media.",Report of any secure wiping and disposal of equipment before disposal or re-use. 
A,11.2.8,Unattended user equipment,"Users should ensure that unattended equipment has appropriate protection. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 All users should be made aware of the security requirements and procedures for protecting unattended equipment, as well as their responsibilities for implementing such protection. Users should be advised to: 
 a) terminate active sessions when finished, unless they can be secured by an appropriate locking mechanism, e.g. a password protected screen saver; 
 b) log-off from applications or network services when no longer needed; 
 c) secure computers or mobile devices from unauthorized use by a key lock or an equivalent control, e.g. password access, when not in use.",Session timeout policy for critical applications. 
A,11.2.9,Clear desk and clear screen policy,"A clear desk policy for papers and removable storage media and a clear screen policy for information processing facilities should be adopted. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The clear desk and clear screen policy should take into account the information classifications, legal and contractual requirements and the corresponding risks and cultural aspects of the organization. The following guidelines should be considered: 
 a) sensitive or critical business information, e.g. on paper or on electronic storage media, should be locked away (ideally in a safe or cabinet or other forms of security furniture) when not required, especially when the office is vacated. 
 b) computers and terminals should be left logged off or protected with a screen and keyboard locking mechanism controlled by a password, token or similar user authentication mechanism when unattended and should be protected by key locks, passwords or other controls when not in use; 
 c) unauthorised use of photocopiers and other reproduction technology (e.g. scanners, digital cameras) should be prevented; 
 d) media containing sensitive or classified information should be removed from printers immediately. 
 
 Other information 
 A clear desk/clear screen policy reduces the risks of unauthorized access, loss of and damage to information during and outside normal working hours. Safes or other forms of secure storage facilities might also protect information stored therein against disasters such as a fire, earthquake, flood or explosion. 
 
 Consider the use of printers with PIN code function, so the originators are the only ones who can get their print-outs and only when standing next to the printer.",Clear desk and clear screen policy. Screen lockout policy for machines. 
A,12.1.1,Documented operating procedures,"Operating procedures should be documented and made available to all users who need them. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Documented procedures should be prepared for operational activities associated with information processing and communication facilities, such as computer start-up and close-down procedures, backup, equipment maintenance, media handling, computer room and mail handling management and safety. 
 
 The operating procedures should specify the operational instructions, including: 
 a) the installation and configuration of systems; 
 b) processing and handling of information both automated and manual; 
 c) backup; 
 d) scheduling requirements, including interdependencies with other systems, earliest job start and latest job completion times; 
 e) instructions for handling errors or other exceptional conditions, which might arise during job execution, including restrictions on the use of system utilities; 
 f) support and escalation contacts including external support contacts in the event of unexpected operational or technical difficulties; 
 g) special output and media handling instructions, such as the use of special stationery or the management of confidential output including procedures for secure disposal of output from failed jobs; 
 h) system restart and recovery procedures for use in the event of system failure; 
 i) the management of audit-trail and system log information; 
 j) monitoring procedures. 
 
 Operating procedures and the documented procedures for system activities should be treated as formal documents and changes authorized by management. Where technically feasible, information systems should be managed consistently, using the same procedures, tools and utilities.",Documented operating procedures. 
A,12.1.2,Change management,"Changes to the organization, business processes, information processing facilities and systems that affect information security should be controlled. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 In particular, the following items should be considered: 
 a) identification and recording of significant changes; 
 b) planning and testing of changes; 
 c) assessment of the potential impacts, including information security impacts, of such changes; 
 d) formal approval procedure for proposed changes; 
 e) verification that information security requirements have been met; 
 f) communication of change details to all relevant persons; 
 g) fall-back procedures, including procedures and responsibilities for aborting and recovering from unsuccessful changes and unforeseen events; 
 h) provision of an emergency change process to enable quick and controlled implementation of changes needed to resolve an incident. 
 
 Formal management responsibilities and procedures should be in place to ensure satisfactory control of all changes. When changes are made, an audit log containing all relevant information should be retained. 
 
 Other information 
 Inadequate control of changes to information processing facilities and systems is a common cause of system or security failures. Changes to the operational environment, especially when transferring a system from development to operational stage, can impact on the reliability of applications.",Change policy and procedure. A sample ticket of a major change with all details included. 
A,12.1.3,Capacity management,"The use of resources should be monitored, tuned and projections made of future capacity requirements to ensure the required system performance. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 Capacity requirements should be identified, taking into account the business criticality of the concerned system. System tuning and monitoring should be applied to ensure and, where necessary, improve the availability and efficiency of systems. Detective controls should be put in place to indicate problems in due time. Projections of future capacity requirements should take account of new business and system requirements and current and projected trends in the organization's information processing capabilities. 
 
 Particular attention needs to be paid to any resources with long procurement lead times or high costs; therefore managers should monitor the utilization of key system resources. They should identify trends in usage, particularly in relation to business applications or information systems management tools. 
 
 Managers should use this information to identify and avoid potential bottlenecks and dependence on key personnel that might present a threat to system security or services, and plan appropriate action. 
 
 Providing sufficient capacity can be achieved by increasing capacity or by reducing demand. Examples of managing capacity demand include: 
 a) deletion of obsolete data (disk space); 
 b) decommissioning of applications, systems, databases or environments; 
 c) optimising batch processes and schedules; 
 d) optimising application logic or database queries; 
 e) denying or restricting bandwidth for resource-hungry services if these are not business critical (e.g. video streaming). 
 
 A documented capacity management plan should be considered for mission critical systems. 
 
 Other information 
 This control also addresses the capacity of the human resources, as well as offices and facilities.",Capacity management plan and report showing current utilization of resources and demand for new resources. 
A,12.1.4,"Separation of development, testing and operational environments","Development, testing, and operational environments should be separated to reduce the risks of unauthorized access or changes to the operational environment. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The level of separation between operational, testing, and development environments that is necessary to prevent operational problems should be identified and implemented. 
 
 The following items should be considered: 
 a) rules for the transfer of software from development to operational status should be defined and documented; 
 b) development and operational software should run on different systems or computer processors and in different domains or directories; 
 c) changes to operational systems and applications should be tested in a testing or staging environment prior to being applied to operational systems; 
 d) other than in exceptional circumstances, testing should not be done on operational systems; 
 e) compilers, editors and other development tools or system utilities should not be accessible from operational systems when not required; 
 f) users should use different user profiles for operational and testing systems, and menus should display appropriate identification messages to reduce the risk of error; 
 g) sensitive data should not be copied into the testing system environment unless equivalent controls are provided for the testing system. 
 
 Other information 
 Development and testing activities can cause serious problems, e.g. unwanted modification of files or system environment or system failure. There is a need to maintain a known and stable environment in which to perform meaningful testing and to prevent inappropriate developer access to the operational environment. 
 
 Where development and testing personnel have access to the operational system and its information, they may be able to introduce unauthorized and untested code or alter operational data. On some systems this capability could be misused to commit fraud or introduce untested or malicious code, which can cause serious operational problems. 
 
 Development and testing personnel also pose a threat to the confidentiality of operational information. Development and testing activities may cause unintended changes to software or information if they share the same computing environment. Separating development, testing and operational environments is therefore desirable to reduce the risk of accidental change or unauthorized access to operational software and business data.","Network diagram or report showing separation between staging, development, testing, and operational environments. "
A,12.2.1,Controls against malware,"Detection, prevention and recovery controls to protect against malware should be implemented, combined with appropriate user awareness.

 a) establishing a formal policy prohibiting the use of unauthorized software; 
 b) implementing controls that prevent or detect the use of unauthorized software (e.g. application whitelisting); 
 c) implementing controls that prevent or detect the use of known or suspected malicious websites (e.g. blacklisting); 
 d) establishing a formal policy to protect against risks associated with obtaining files and software either from or via external networks or on any other medium, indicating what protective measures should be taken; 
 e) reducing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware, e.g. through technical vulnerability management; 
 f) conducting regular reviews of the software and data content of systems supporting critical business processes; the presence of any unapproved files or unauthorized amendments should be formally investigated; 
 g) installation and regular update of malware detection and repair software to scan computers and media as a precautionary control, or on a routine basis; the scan carried out should include: 
 1) scan any files received over networks or via any form of storage medium, for malware before use; 
 2) scan electronic mail attachments and downloads for malware before use; this scan should be carried out at different places, e.g. at electronic mail servers, desk top computers and when entering the network of the organization; 
 3) scan web pages for malware; 
 h) defining procedures and responsibilities to deal with malware protection on systems, training in their use, reporting and recovering from malware attacks; 
 i) preparing appropriate business continuity plans for recovering from malware attacks, including all necessary data and software backup and recovery arrangements; 
 j) implementing procedures to regularly collect information, such as subscribing to mailing lists or verifying websites giving information about new malware; 
 k) implementing procedures to verify information relating to malware, and ensure that warning bulletins are accurate and informative; managers should ensure that qualified sources, e.g. reputable journals, reliable Internet sites or suppliers producing software protecting against malware, are used to differentiate between hoaxes and real malware; all users should be made aware of the problem of hoaxes and what to do on receipt of them; 
 l) isolating environments where catastrophic impacts may result. 
 
 Other information 
 The use of two or more software products protecting against malware across the information processing environment from different vendors and technology can improve the effectiveness of malware protection. 
 
 Care should be taken to protect against the introduction of malware during maintenance and emergency procedures, which may bypass normal malware protection controls. 
 
 Under certain conditions, malware protection might cause disturbance within operations. 
 
 Use of malware detection and repair software alone as a malware control is not usually adequate and commonly needs to be accompanied by operating procedures that prevent introduction of malware.",Antivirus policy and screenshot of latest virus definition update. 
A,12.3.1,Information backup,"Backup copies of information, software and system images should be taken and tested regularly in accordance with an agreed backup policy. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 A backup policy should be established to define the organization's requirements for backup of information, software and systems. 
 
 The backup policy should define the retention and protection requirements. 
 
 Adequate backup facilities should be provided to ensure that all essential information and software can be recovered following a disaster or media failure. 
 
 When designing a backup plan, the following items should be taken into consideration: 
 a) accurate and complete records of the backup copies and documented restoration procedures should be produced; 
 b) the extent (e.g. full or differential backup) and frequency of backups should reflect the business requirements of the organization, the security requirements of the information involved and the criticality of the information to the continued operation of the organization; 
 c) the backups should be stored in a remote location, at a sufficient distance to escape any damage from a disaster at the main site; 
 d) backup information should be given an appropriate level of physical and environmental protection consistent with the standards applied at the main site; 
 e) backup media should be regularly tested to ensure that they can be relied upon for emergency use when necessary; this should be combined with a test of the restoration procedures and checked against the restoration time required. Testing the ability to restore backed-up data should be performed onto dedicated test media, not by overwriting the original media in case the backup or restoration process fails and causes irreparable data damage or loss; 
 f) insituationswhereconfidentialityisofimportance,backupsshouldbeprotectedbymeansofencryption. 
 
 Operational procedures should monitor the execution of backups and address failures of scheduled backups to ensure completeness of backups according to the backup policy. 
 
 Backup arrangements for individual systems and services should be regularly tested to ensure that they meet the requirements of business continuity plans. In the case of critical systems and services, backup arrangements should cover all systems information, applications and data necessary to recover the complete system in the event of a disaster. 
 
 The retention period for essential business information should be determined, taking into account any requirement for archive copies to be permanently retained.",Screenshot of backup policy in the backup solution and reports of successful backups in the last 24 hours. Sample report of successful restoration of backup. 
A,12.4.1,Event logging,"Event logs recording user activities, exceptions, faults and information security events should be produced, kept and regularly reviewed. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Event logs should include, when relevant: 
 a) user IDs; 
 b) system activities; 
 c) dates, times and details of key events, e.g. log-on and log-off; 
 d) device identity or location if possible and system identifier; 
 e) records of successful and rejected system access attempts; 
 f) records of successful and rejected data and other resource access attempts; 
 g) changes to system configuration; 
 h) use of privileges; 
 i) use of system utilities and applications; 
 j) files accessed and the kind of access; 
 k) network addresses and protocols; 
 l) alarms raised by the access control system; 
 m) activation and de-activation of protection systems, such as anti-virus systems and intrusion detection systems; 
 n) records of transactions executed by users in applications. 
 
 Event logging sets the foundation for automated monitoring systems which are capable of generating consolidated reports and alerts on system security. 
 
 Other information 
 Event logs can contain sensitive data and personally identifiable information. Appropriate privacy protection measures should be taken. 
 
 Where possible, system administrators should not have permission to erase or de-activate logs of their own activities.","Evidence of using systems for logging and monitoring such as SIEM solutions including various logs such as audit logs, fault logs, etc."
A,12.4.2,Protection of log information,"Logging facilities and log information should be protected against tampering and unauthorized access. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 Controls should aim to protect against unauthorized changes to log information and operational problems with the logging facility including: 
 a) alterations to the message types that are recorded; 
 b) log files being edited or deleted; 
 c) storage capacity of the log file media being exceeded, resulting in either the failure to record events or over-writing of past recorded events. 
 
 Some audit logs may be required to be archived as part of the record retention policy or because of requirements to collect and retain evidence. 
 
 Other information 
 System logs often contain a large volume of information, much of which is extraneous to information security monitoring. To help identify significant events for information security monitoring purposes, the copying of appropriate message types automatically to a second log, or the use of suitable system utilities or audit tools to perform file interrogation and rationalization should be considered. 
 
 System logs need to be protected, because if the data can be modified or data in them deleted, their existence may create a false sense of security. Real-time copying of logs to a system outside the control of a system administrator or operator can be used to safeguard logs.",Evidence of applying access control on logging systems and servers. 
A,12.4.3,Administrator and operator logs,"System administrator and system operator activities should be logged and the logs protected and regularly reviewed. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Privileged user account holders may be able to manipulate the logs on information processing facilities under their direct control, therefore it is necessary to protect and review the logs to maintain accountability for the privileged users. 
 
 Other information 
 An intrusion detection system managed outside of the control of system and network administrators can be used to monitor system and network administration activities for compliance.",Evidence for logging administrator activities. 
A,12.4.4,Clock synchronisation,"The clocks of all relevant information processing systems within an organization or security domain should be synchronized to a single reference time source. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 External and internal requirements for time representation, synchronisation and accuracy should be documented. Such requirements can be legal, regulatory, contractual requirements, standards compliance or requirements for internal monitoring. A standard reference time for use within the organization should be defined. 
 
 The organization's approach to obtaining a reference time from external source(s) and how to synchronise internal clocks reliably should be documented and implemented. 
 
 Other information 
 The correct setting of computer clocks is important to ensure the accuracy of audit logs, which may be required for investigations or as evidence in legal or disciplinary cases. Inaccurate audit logs may hinder such investigations and damage the credibility of such evidence. A clock linked to a radio time broadcast from a national atomic clock can be used as the master clock for logging systems. A network time protocol can be used to keep all of the servers in synchronisation with the master clock.",Evidence of using protocols or systems such as network time protocol for clock synchronization. 
A,12.5.1,Installation of software on operational systems,"Procedures should be implemented to control the installation of software on operational systems. 
 
 The following guidelines should be considered to control changes of software on operational systems: 
 a) the updating of the operational software, applications and program libraries should only be performed by trained administrators upon appropriate management authorization; 
 b) operational systems should only hold approved executable code and not development code or compilers; 
 c) applications and operating system software should only be implemented after extensive and successful testing; the tests should cover usability, security, effects on other systems and user- friendliness and should be carried out on separate systems; it should be ensured that all corresponding program source libraries have been updated; 
 d) a configuration control system should be used to keep control of all implemented software as well as the system documentation; 
 e) a rollback strategy should be in place before changes are implemented; 
 f) an audit log should be maintained of all updates to operational program libraries; 
 g) previous versions of application software should be retained as a contingency measure; 
 h) old versions of software should be archived, together with all required information and parameters, procedures, configuration details and supporting software for as long as the data are retained in archive. 
 
 Vendor supplied software used in operational systems should be maintained at a level supported by the supplier. Over time, software vendors will cease to support older versions of software. The organization should consider the risks of relying on unsupported software. 
 
 Any decision to upgrade to a new release should take into account the business requirements for the change and the security of the release, e.g. the introduction of new information security functionality or the number and severity of information security problems affecting this version. Software patches should be applied when they can help to remove or reduce information security weaknesses. 
 
 Physical or logical access should only be given to suppliers for support purposes when necessary and with management approval. The supplier's activities should be monitored. 
 
 Computer software may rely on externally supplied software and modules, which should be monitored and controlled to avoid unauthorized changes, which could introduce security weaknesses.",Sample request and procedure followed for installation of software on operational systems. 
A,12.6.1,Management of technical vulnerabilities,"Information about technical vulnerabilities of information systems being used should be obtained in a timely fashion, the organization's exposure to such vulnerabilities evaluated and appropriate measures taken to address the associated risk. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 A current and complete inventory of assets is a prerequisite for effective technical vulnerability management. Specific information needed to support technical vulnerability management includes the software vendor, version numbers, current state of deployment (e.g. what software is installed on what systems) and the person(s) within the organization responsible for the software. 
 
 Appropriate and timely action should be taken in response to the identification of potential technical vulnerabilities. The following guidance should be followed to establish an effective management process for technical vulnerabilities: 
 a) the organization should define and establish the roles and responsibilities associated with technical vulnerability management, including vulnerability monitoring, vulnerability risk assessment, patching, asset tracking and any coordination responsibilities required; 
 b) information resources that will be used to identify relevant technical vulnerabilities and to maintain awareness about them should be identified for software and other technology based on the asset inventory list; these information resources should be updated based on changes in the inventory or when other new or useful resources are found; 
 c) a timeline should be defined to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical vulnerabilities; 
 d) once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, the organization should identify the associated risks and the actions to be taken; such action could involve patching of vulnerable systems or applying other controls; 
 e) depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, the action taken should be carried out according to the controls related to change management or by following information security incident response procedures; 
 f) if a patch is available from a legitimate source, the risks associated with installing the patch should be assessed (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the patch); 
 g) patches should be tested and evaluated before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be tolerated; if no patch is available, other controls should be considered, such as: 
 1) turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability; 
 2) adapting or adding access controls, e.g. firewalls, at network borders; 
 3) increased monitoring to detect actual attacks; 
 4) raising awareness of the vulnerability; 
 h) an audit log should be kept for all procedures undertaken; 
 i) the technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency; 
 j) systems at high risk should be addressed first; 
 k) an effective technical vulnerability management process should be aligned with incident management activities, to communicate data on vulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide technical procedures to be carried out should an incident occur; 
 l) define a procedure to address the situation where a vulnerability has been identified but there is no suitable countermeasure. In this situation, the organization should evaluate risks relating to the known vulnerability and define appropriate detective and corrective actions. 
 
 Other information 
 Technical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as 
 such can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures. 
 
 Vendors are often under significant pressure to release patches as soon as possible. Therefore, there is a possibility that a patch does not address the problem adequately and has negative side effects. Also, in some cases, uninstalling a patch cannot be easily achieved once the patch has been applied. 
 
 If adequate testing of the patches is not possible, e.g. because of costs or lack of resources, a delay in patching can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other users. The use of ISO/IEC 27031[14] can be beneficial.",Technical assessment reports such as reports of vulnerability scans. Reports of patch management and applying latest security patches. 
A,12.6.2,Restrictions on software installation,"Rules governing the installation of software by users should be established and implemented. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The organization should define and enforce strict policy on which types of software users may install. 
 
 The principle of least privilege should be applied. If granted certain privileges, users may have the ability to install software. The organization should identify what types of software installations are permitted (e.g. updates and security patches to existing software) and what types of installations are prohibited (e.g. software that is only for personal use and software whose pedigree with regard to being potentially malicious is unknown or suspect). These privileges should be granted having regard to the roles of the users concerned. 
 
 Other information 
 Uncontrolled installation of software on computing devices can lead to introducing vulnerabilities and then to information leakage, loss of integrity or other information security incidents, or to violation of intellectual property rights.",Access matrix showing access right limitation of normal end users. 
A,12.7.1,Information systems audit controls,"Audit requirements and activities involving verification of operational systems should be carefully planned and agreed to minimize disruptions to business processes. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The following guidelines should be observed: 
 a) audit requirements for access to systems and data should be agreed with appropriate management; 
 b) the scope of technical audit tests should be agreed and controlled; 
 c) audit tests should be limited to read-only access to software and data; 
 d) access other than read-only should only be allowed for isolated copies of system files, which should be erased when the audit is completed, or given appropriate protection if there is an obligation to keep such files under audit documentation requirements; 
 e) requirements for special or additional processing should be identified and agreed; 
 f) audit tests that could affect system availability should be run outside business hours; g) all access should be monitored and logged to produce a reference trail.",Policy for controlling audits of operational systems and avoiding any disruption due to these audits. 
A,13.1.1,Network controls,"Networks should be managed and controlled to protect information in systems and applications 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Controls should be implemented to ensure the security of information in networks and the protection of connected services from unauthorized access. In particular, the following items should be considered: 
 a) responsibilities and procedures for the management of networking equipment should be established; 
 b) operational responsibility for networks should be separated from computer operations where 
 appropriate; 
 c) special controls should be established to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of data passing over public networks or over wireless networks and to protect the connected systems and applications; special controls may also be required to maintain the availability of the network services and computers connected; 
 d) appropriate logging and monitoring should be applied to enable recording and detection of actions that may affect, or are relevant to, information security; 
 e) management activities should be closely coordinated both to optimize the service to the organization and to ensure that controls are consistently applied across the information processing infrastructure; 
 f) systems on the network should be authenticated; 
 g) systems connection to the network should be restricted. 
 
 Other information 
 Additional information on network security can be found in ISO/IEC 27033.[15][16][17][18][19]",Network diagram showing network security controls implemented and technical assessment report for the network. 
A,13.1.2,Security of network services,"Security mechanisms, service levels and management requirements of all network services should be identified and included in network services agreements, whether these services are provided in-house or outsourced. 
 
Implementation Guidance 
The ability of the network service provider to manage agreed services in a secure way should be determined and regularly monitored, and the right to audit should be agreed. 
 
 The security arrangements necessary for particular services, such as security features, service levels and management requirements, should be identified. The organization should ensure that network service providers implement these measures. 
 
 Other information 
 Network services include the provision of connections, private network services and value added networks and managed network security solutions such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These services can range from simple unmanaged bandwidth to complex value-added offerings. 
 
 Security features of network services could be: 
 a) technology applied for security of network services, such as authentication, encryption and network connection controls; 
 b) technical parameters required for secured connection with the network services in accordance with the security and network connection rules; 
 c) procedures for the network service usage to restrict access to network services or applications, where necessary.",Agreement with network service provider including service level agreements. 
A,13.1.3,Segregation in networks,"Groups of information services, users and information systems should be segregated on networks. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 One method of managing the security of large networks is to divide them into separate network domains. The domains can be chosen based on trust levels (e.g. public access domain, desktop domain, server domain), along organizational units (e.g. human resources, finance, marketing) or some combination (e.g. server domain connecting to multiple organizational units). The segregation can be done using either physically different networks or by using different logical networks (e.g.virtual private networking). 
 
 The perimeter of each domain should be well defined. Access between network domains is allowed, but should be controlled at the perimeter using a gateway (e.g. firewall, filtering router). The criteria for segregation of networks into domains, and the access allowed through the gateways, should be based on an assessment of the security requirements of each domain. The assessment should be in accordance with the access control policy, access requirements, value and classification of information processed and also take account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating suitable gateway technology. 
 
 Wireless networks require special treatment due to the poorly defined network perimeter. For sensitive environments, consideration should be made to treat all wireless access as external connections and to segregate this access from internal networks until the access has passed through a gateway in accordance with network controls policy before granting access to internal systems. 
 
 The authentication, encryption and user level network access control technologies of modern, standards based wireless networks may be sufficient for direct connection to the organization's internal network when properly implemented. 
 
 Other information 
 Networks often extend beyond organizational boundaries, as business partnerships are formed that require the interconnection or sharing of information processing and networking facilities. Such extensions can increase the risk of unauthorized access to the organization's information systems that use the network, some of which require protection from other network users because of their sensitivity or criticality.",Network diagram showing segregation in networks. 
A,13.2.1,Information transfer policies and procedures,"Formal transfer policies, procedures and controls should be in place to protect the transfer of information through the use of all types of communication facilities. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The procedures and controls to be followed when using communication facilities for information transfer should consider the following items: 
 a) procedures designed to protect transferred information from interception, copying, modification, mis-routing and destruction; 
 b) procedures for the detection of and protection against malware that may be transmitted through the use of electronic communications; 
 c) procedures for protecting communicated sensitive electronic information that is in the form of an attachment; 
 d) policy or guidelines outlining acceptable use of communication facilities; 
 e) personnel, external party and any other user's responsibilities not to compromise the organization, e.g. through defamation, harassment, impersonation, forwarding of chain letters, unauthorized purchasing, etc.;

 4) new development tools and environments; 
 5) changes to physical location of service facilities; 
 6) change of suppliers; 
 7) sub-contracting to another supplier.",Process for controlling changes to supplier services. 
A,16.1.1,Responsibilities and procedures,"Management responsibilities and procedures should be established to ensure a quick, effective and orderly response to information security incidents. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 The following guidelines for management responsibilities and procedures with regard to information security incident management should be considered: 
 a) management responsibilities should be established to ensure that the following procedures are developed and communicated adequately within the organization: 
 1) procedures for incident response planning and preparation; 
 2) procedures for monitoring, detecting, analysing and reporting of information security events and incidents; 
 3) procedures for logging incident management activities; 
 4) procedures for handling of forensic evidence; 
 5) procedures for assessment of and decision on information security events and assessment of information security weaknesses; 
 6) procedures for response including those for escalation, controlled recovery from an incident and communication to internal and external people or organizations; 
 b) procedures established should ensure that: 
 1) competent personnel handle the issues related to information security incidents within the organization; 
 2) a point of contact for security incidents' detection and reporting is implemented; 
 3) appropriate contacts with authorities, external interest groups or forums that handle the issues related to information security incidents are maintained; 
 c) reporting procedures should include: 
 1) preparing information security event reporting forms to support the reporting action and to help the person reporting to remember all necessary actions in case of an information security event; 
 2) the procedure to be undertaken in case of an information security event, e.g. noting all details immediately, such as type of non-compliance or breach, occurring malfunction, messages on the screen and immediately reporting to the point of contact and taking only coordinated actions; 
 3) reference to an established formal disciplinary process for dealing with employees who commit security breaches; 
 4) suitable feedback processes to ensure that those persons reporting information security events are notified of results after the issue has been dealt with and closed. 
 
 The objectives for information security incident management should be agreed with management, and it should be ensured that those responsible for information security incident management understand the organization's priorities for handling information security incidents. 
 
 Other information 
 Information security incidents might transcend organizational and national boundaries. To respond to such incidents there is an increasing need to coordinate response and share information about these incidents with external organizations as appropriate. 
 
 Detailed guidance on information security incident management is provided in ISO/IEC 27035.[20]",Incident management process including the team roles and responsibilities. 
A,16.1.2,Reporting information security events,"Information security events should be reported through appropriate management channels as quickly as possible. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 All employees and contractors should be made aware of their responsibility to report information security events as quickly as possible. They should also be aware of the procedure for reporting information security events and the point of contact to which the events should be reported. 
 
 Situations to be considered for information security event reporting include: 
 a) ineffective security control; 
 b) breach of information integrity, confidentiality or availability expectations; 
 c) human errors; 
 d) non-compliances with policies or guidelines; 
 e) breaches of physical security arrangements; 
 f) uncontrolled system changes; 
 g) malfunctions of software or hardware; 
 h) access violations. 
 
 Other information 
 Malfunctions or other anomalous system behaviour may be an indicator of a security attack or actual security breach and should therefore always be reported as an information security event.",Process for reporting information security events. 
A,16.1.3,Reporting information security weaknesses,"Employees and contractors using the organization's information systems and services should be required to note and report any observed or suspected information security weaknesses in systems or services. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 All employees and contractors should report these matters to the point of contact as quickly as possible in order to prevent information security incidents. The reporting mechanism should be as easy, accessible and available as possible. 
 
 Other information 
 Employees and contractors should be advised not to attempt to prove suspected security weaknesses. Testing weaknesses might be interpreted as a potential misuse of the system and could also cause damage to the information system or service and result in legal liability for the individual performing the testing.",Process for reporting information security weaknesses. 
A,16.1.4,Assessment of and decision on information security events,"Information security events should be assessed and it should be decided if they are to be classified as information security incidents. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 The point of contact should assess each information security event using the agreed information security event and incident classification scale and decide whether the event should be classified as an information security incident. Classification and prioritization of incidents can help to identify the impact and extent of an incident. 
 
 In cases where the organization has an information security incident response team (ISIRT), the assessment and decision can be forwarded to the ISIRT for confirmation or reassessment. 
 
 Results of the assessment and decision should be recorded in detail for the purpose of future reference and verification.",Incident analysis process and sample incident with analysis and evaluation steps followed.
A,16.1.5,Response to information security incidents,"Information security incidents should be response to in accordance with the documented procedures. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 Information security incidents should be responded to by a nominated point of contact and other relevant persons of the organization or external parties. 
 
 The response should include the following: 
 a) collecting evidence as soon as possible after the occurrence; 
 b) conducting information security forensics analysis, as required; 
 c) escalation, as required; 
 d) ensuring that all involved response activities are properly logged for later analysis; 
 e) communicating the existence of the information security incident or any relevant details thereof to other internal and external people or organizations with a need-to-know; 
 f) dealing with information security weakness(es) found to cause or contribute to the incident; g) once the incident has been successfully dealt with, formally closing and recording it. Post-incident analysis should take place, as necessary, to identify the source of the incident. Other information 
 
 The first goal of incident response is to resume 'normal security level' and then initiate the necessary recovery.",Incident response process and sample incident with response steps followed.
A,16.1.6,Learning from information security incidents,"Knowledge gained from analyzing and resolving information security incidents should be used to reduce the likelihood or impact of future incidents. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 There should be mechanisms in place to enable the types, volumes and costs of information security incidents to be quantified and monitored. The information gained from the evaluation of information security incidents should be used to identify recurring or high impact incidents. 
 
 Other information 
 The evaluation of information security incidents may indicate the need for enhanced or additional controls to limit the frequency, damage and cost of future occurrences, or to be taken into account in the security policy review process. 
 
 With due care of confidentiality aspects, anecdotes from actual information security incidents can be used in user awareness training as examples of what could happen, how to respond to such incidents and how to avoid them in the future.",Incident management process including recording lessons learned. Sample incident with identified lessons learned. 
A,16.1.7,Collection of evidence,"The organization should define and apply procedures for the identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of information, which can serve as evidence. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Internal procedures should be developed and followed when dealing with evidence for the purposes of disciplinary and legal action. 
 
 In general, these procedures for evidence should provide processes of identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of evidence in accordance with different types of media, devices and status of devices, e.g. powered on or off. The procedures should take account of: 
 a) chain of custody; 
 b) safety of evidence; 
 c) safety of personnel; 
 d) roles and responsibilities of personnel involved; 
 e) competency of personnel; 
 f) documentation; 
 g) briefing. 
 
 Where available, certification or other relevant means of qualification of personnel and tools should be sought, so as to strengthen the value of the preserved evidence. 
 
 Forensic evidence may transcend organizational or jurisdictional boundaries. In such cases, it should be ensured that the organization is entitled to collect the required information as forensic evidence. The requirements of different jurisdictions should also be considered to maximize chances of admission across the relevant jurisdictions. 
 
 Other information 
 Identification is the process involving the search for, recognition and documentation of potential evidence. Collection is the process of gathering the physical items that can contain potential evidence. Acquisition is the process of creating a copy of data within a defined set. Preservation is the process to maintain and safeguard the integrity and original condition of the potential evidence. 
 
 When an information security event is first detected, it may not be obvious whether or not the event will result in court action. Therefore, the danger exists that necessary evidence is destroyed intentionally or accidentally before the seriousness of the incident is realized. It is advisable to involve a lawyer or the police early in any contemplated legal action and take advice on the evidence required. 
 
 ISO/IEC 27037[24] provides guidelines for identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of digital evidence.",Process for collection of digital evidence or agreement with third party for digital forensics service.
A,17.1.1,Planning information security continuity,"The organization should determine its requirements for information security and the continuity of information security management in adverse situations, e.g. during a crisis or disaster. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 An organization should determine whether the continuity of information security is captured within the business continuity management process or within the disaster recovery management process. Information security requirements should be determined when planning for business continuity and disaster recovery. 
 
 In the absence of formal business continuity and disaster recovery planning, information security management should assume that information security requirements remain the same in adverse situations, compared to normal operational conditions. Alternatively, an organization could perform a business impact analysis for information security aspects to determine the information security requirements applicable to adverse situations. 
 
 Other information 
 In order to reduce the time and effort of an 'additional' business impact analysis for information security, it is recommended to capture information security aspects within the normal business continuity management or disaster recovery management business impact analysis. This implies that the information security continuity requirements are explicitly formulated in the business continuity management or disaster recovery management processes. 
 
 Information on business continuity management can be found in ISO/IEC 27031,[14] ISO 22313[9] and ISO 22301.[8]",Business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
A,17.1.2,Implementing information security continuity,"The organization should establish, document, implement and maintain processes, procedures and controls to ensure the required level of continuity for information security during an adverse situation. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 An organization should ensure that: 
 a) an adequate management structure is in place to prepare for, mitigate and respond to a disruptive event using personnel with the necessary authority, experience and competence; 
 b) incident response personnel with the necessary responsibility, authority and competence to manage an incident and maintain information security are nominated; 
 c) documented plans, response and recovery procedures are developed and approved, detailing how the organization will manage a disruptive event and will maintain its information security to a predetermined level, based on management-approved information security continuity objectives. 
 
 According to the information security continuity requirements, the organization should establish, document, implement and maintain: 
 a) information security controls within business continuity or disaster recovery processes, procedures and supporting systems and tools; 
 b) processes, procedures and implementation changes to maintain existing information security controls during an adverse situation; 
 c) compensating controls for information security controls that cannot be maintained during an adverse situation. 
 
 Other information 
 Within the context of business continuity or disaster recovery, specific processes and procedures may have been defined. Information that is handled within these processes and procedures or within dedicated information systems to support them should be protected. Therefore an organization should involve information security specialists when establishing, implementing and maintaining business continuity or disaster recovery processes and procedures. 
 
 Information security controls that have been implemented should continue to operate during an adverse situation. If security controls are not able to continue to secure information, other controls should be established, implemented and maintained to maintain an acceptable level of information security.",Business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
A,17.1.3,"Verify, review and evaluate information security continuity","The organization should verify the established and implemented information security continuity controls at regular intervals in order to ensure that they are valid and effective during adverse situations. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Organizational, technical, procedural and process changes, whether in an operational or continuity context, can lead to changes in information security continuity requirements. In such cases, the continuity of processes, procedures and controls for information security should be reviewed against these changed requirements. 
 
 Organizations should verify their information security management continuity by: 
 a) exercising and testing the functionality of information security continuity processes, procedures and controls to ensure that they are consistent with the information security continuity objectives; 
 b) exercising and testing the knowledge and routine to operate information security continuity processes, procedures and controls to ensure that their performance is consistent with the information security continuity objectives; 
 c) reviewing the validity and effectiveness of information security continuity measures when information systems, information security processes, procedures and controls or business continuity management/disaster recovery management processes and solutions change. 
 
Other information 
The verification of information security continuity controls is different from general information security testing and verification and should be performed outside the testing of changes. If possible, it is preferable to integrate verification of information security continuity controls with the organization's business continuity or disaster recovery tests.",Test report for business continuity plans and recovery plan testing reports. 
A,17.2.1,Availability of information processing facilities,"Information processing facilities should be implemented with redundancy sufficient to meet availability requirements. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 Organizations should identify business requirements for the availability of information systems. Where the availability cannot be guaranteed using the existing systems architecture, redundant components or architectures should be considered. 
 
 Where applicable, redundant information systems should be tested to ensure the failover from one component to another component works as intended. 
 
 Other Information 
 The implementation of redundancies can introduce risks to the integrity or confidentiality of information and information systems, which need to be considered when designing information systems.",Network diagram with proof of redundancy of information systems and network diagram of the disaster recovery site. 
A,18.1.1,Identification of applicable legislation and contractual requirements,"All relevant legislative statutory, regulatory, contractual requirements and the organization's approach to meet these requirements should be explicitly identified, documented and kept up to date for each information system and the organization. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 The specific controls and individual responsibilities to meet these requirements should also be defined and documented. 
 
 Managers should identify all legislation applicable to their organization in order to meet the requirements for their type of business. If the organization conducts business in other countries, managers should consider compliance in all relevant countries.",Procedure for identification of applicable legislation and contractual requirements and list of applicable laws and regulations document. 
A,18.1.2,Intellectual property rights,"Appropriate procedures should be implemented to ensure compliance with legislative, regulatory and contractual requirements related to intellectual property rights and use of proprietary software products. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 The following guidelines should be considered to protect any material that may be considered intellectual property: 
 a) publishing an intellectual property rights compliance policy which defines the legal use of software and information products; 
 b) acquiring software only through known and reputable sources, to ensure that copyright is not violated; 
 c) maintaining awareness of policies to protect intellectual property rights and giving notice of the intent to take disciplinary action against personnel breaching them; 
 d) maintaining appropriate asset registers and identifying all assets with requirements to protect intellectual property rights; 
 e) maintaining proof and evidence of ownership of licenses, master disks, manuals, etc.; 
 f) implementing controls to ensure that any maximum number of users permitted within the license is not exceeded; 
 g) carrying out reviews that only authorized software and licensed products are installed; 
 h) providing a policy for maintaining appropriate license conditions; 
 i) providing a policy for disposing of or transferring software to others; 
 j) complying with terms and conditions for software and information obtained from public networks; 
 k) not duplicating, converting to another format or extracting from commercial recordings (film, audio) other than permitted by copyright law; 
 l) not copying in full or in part, books, articles, reports or other documents, other than permitted by copyright law. 
 
 Other information 
 Intellectual property rights include software or document copyright, design rights, trademarks, patents and source code licences. 
 
 Proprietary software products are usually supplied under a licence agreement that specifies licence terms and conditions, for example, limiting the use of the products to specified machines or limiting copying to the creation of backup copies only. The importance and awareness of intellectual property rights should be communicated to staff for software developed by the organization. 
 
 Legislative, regulatory and contractual requirements may place restrictions on the copying of proprietary material. In particular, they may require that only material that is developed by the organization or that is licensed or provided by the developer to the organization, can be used. Copyright infringement can lead to legal action, which may involve fines and criminal proceedings.",Compliance policy with statements related to protection of intellectual property rights and relevant clauses in supplier contracts. 
A,18.1.3,Protection of records,"Records should be protected from loss, destruction, falsification, unauthorized access and unauthorized release, in accordance with legislatory, regulatory, contractual and business requirements. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 When deciding upon protection of specific organizational records, their corresponding classification based on the organization's classification scheme, should be considered. Records should be categorised into record types, e.g. accounting records, database records, transaction logs, audit logs and operational procedures, each with details of retention periods and type of allowable storage media, e.g. paper, microfiche, magnetic, optical. Any related cryptographic keys and programs associated with encrypted archives or digital signatures, should also be stored to enable decryption of the records for the length of time the records are retained. 
 
 Consideration should be given to the possibility of deterioration of media used for storage of records. Storage and handling procedures should be implemented in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. 
 
 Where electronic storage media are chosen, procedures to ensure the ability to access data (both media and format readability) throughout the retention period should be established to safeguard against loss due to future technology change. 
 
 Data storage systems should be chosen such that required data can be retrieved in an acceptable timeframe and format, depending on the requirements to be fulfilled. 
 
 The system of storage and handling should ensure identification of records and of their retention period as defined by national or regional legislation or regulations, if applicable. This system should permit appropriate destruction of records after that period if they are not needed by the organization. 
 
 To meet these record safeguarding objectives, the following steps should be taken within an organization: 
 a) guidelines should be issued on the retention, storage, handling and disposal of records and information; 
 b) a retention schedule should be drawn up identifying records and the period of time for which they should be retained; 
 c) an inventory of sources of key information should be maintained. 
 
 Other information 
 Some records may need to be securely retained to meet statutory, regulatory or contractual requirements, as well as to support essential business activities. Examples include records that may be required as evidence that an organization operates within statutory or regulatory rules, to ensure defence against potential civil or criminal action or to confirm the financial status of an organization to shareholders, external parties and auditors. National law or regulation may set the time period and data content for information retention. 
 
 Further information about managing organizational records can be found in ISO 15489-1.[5]",Evidence of controls for protection of organization's records. 
A,18.1.4,Privacy and protection of personally identifiable information,"Privacy and protection of personally identifiable information should be ensured as required in relevant legislation and regulation where applicable. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 An organization's data policy for privacy and protection of personally identifiable information should be developed and implemented. This policy should be communicated to all persons involved in the processing of personally identifiable information. 
 
 Compliance with this policy and all relevant legislation and regulations concerning the protection of the privacy of people and the protection of personally identifiable information requires appropriate management structure and control. Often this is best achieved by the appointment of a person responsible, such as a privacy officer, who should provide guidance to managers, users and service providers on their individual responsibilities and the specific procedures that should be followed. Responsibility for handling personally identifiable information and ensuring awareness of the privacy principles should be dealt with in accordance with relevant legislation and regulations. Appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personally identifiable information should be implemented. 
 
 Other information 
 ISO/IEC 29100[25] provides a high-level framework for the protection of personally identifiable information within information and communication technology systems. A number of countries have introduced legislation placing controls on the collection, processing and transmission of personally identifiable information (generally information on living individuals who can be identified from that information). Depending on the respective national legislation, such controls may impose duties on those collecting, processing and disseminating personally identifiable information, and may also restrict the ability to transfer personally identifiable information to other countries.",Privacy policy and controls for protection of personally identifiable information. 
A,18.1.5,Regulation of cryptographic controls,"Cryptographic controls should be used in compliance with all relevant agreements, legislation and regulations. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 The following items should be considered for compliance with the relevant agreements, laws and regulations: 
 a) restrictions on import or export of computer hardware and software for performing cryptographic functions; 
 b) restrictions on import or export of computer hardware and software which is designed to have cryptographic functions added to it; 
 c) restrictions on the usage of encryption; 
 d) mandatory or discretionary methods of access by the countries' authorities to information encrypted by hardware or software to provide confidentiality of content. 
 
 Legal advice should be sought to ensure compliance with relevant legislation and regulations. Before encrypted information or cryptographic controls are moved across jurisdictional borders, legal advice should also be taken.",Evidence for compliance with cryptographic controls regulations. 
A,18.2.1,Independent review of information security,"The organization's approach to managing information security and its implementation (i.e. control objectives, controls, policies, processes and procedures for information security) should be reviewed independently at planned intervals or when significant changes occur. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 Management should initiate the independent review. Such an independent review is necessary to ensure the continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the organization's approach to managing information security. The review should include assessing opportunities for improvement and the need for changes to the approach to security, including the policy and control objectives. 
 
 Such a review should be carried out by individuals independent of the area under review, e.g. the internal audit function, an independent manager or an external party organization specializing in such reviews. Individuals carrying out these reviews should have the appropriate skills and experience. 
 
 The results of the independent review should be recorded and reported to the management who initiated the review. These records should be maintained. 
 
 If the independent review identifies that the organization's approach and implementation to managing information security is inadequate, e.g. documented objectives and requirements are not met or not compliant with the direction for information security stated in the information security policies, management should consider corrective actions. 
 
 Other information 
 ISO/IEC 27007[12], "Guidelines for information security management systems auditing" and ISO/IEC TR 27008[13], "Guidelines for auditors on information security controls" also provide guidance for carrying out the independent review.",Latest audit report with findings. 
A,18.2.2,Compliance with security policies and standards,"Managers should regularly review the compliance of information processing and procedures within their area of responsibility with the appropriate security policies, standards and any other security requirements. 
 
 Implementation Guidance 
 Managers should identify how to review that information security requirements defined in policies, standards and other applicable regulations are met. Automatic measurement and reporting tools should be considered for efficient regular review. 
 
 If any non-compliance is found as a result of the review, managers should: 
 a) identify the causes of the non-compliance; 
 b) evaluate the need for actions to achieve compliance; 
 c) implement appropriate corrective action; 
 d) review the corrective action taken to verify its effectiveness and identify any deficiencies or weaknesses. 
 
 Results of reviews and corrective actions carried out by managers should be recorded and these records should be maintained. Managers should report the results to the persons carrying out independent reviews when an independent review takes place in the area of their responsibility. 
 ",Latest compliance check report with findings. 
A,18.2.3,Technical compliance review,"Information system should be regularly reviewed for compliance with the organization's information security policies and standards. 
 
 Implementation guidance 
 Technical compliance should be reviewed preferably with the assistance of automated tools, which generate technical reports for subsequent interpretation by a technical specialist. Alternatively, manual reviews (supported by appropriate software tools, if necessary) by an experienced system engineer could be performed. 
 
 If penetration tests or vulnerability assessments are used, caution should be exercised as such activities could lead to a compromise of the security of the system. Such tests should be planned, documented and repeatable. 
 
 Any technical compliance review should only be carried out by competent, authorized persons or under the supervision of such persons. 
 
 Other information 
 Technical compliance reviews involve the examination of operational systems to ensure that hardware and software controls have been correctly implemented. This type of compliance review requires specialist technical expertise. 
 
 Compliance reviews also cover, for example, penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, which might be carried out by independent experts specifically contracted for this purpose. This can be useful in detecting vulnerabilities in the system and for inspecting how effective the controls are in preventing unauthorized access due to these vulnerabilities. 
 
 Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments provide a snapshot of a system in a specific state at a specific time. The snapshot is limited to those portions of the system actually tested during the penetration attempt(s). Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments are not a substitute for risk assessment. 
 
 ISO/IEC TR 27008[13] provides specific guidance regarding technical compliance reviews.",Latest technical assessment report with evidence tracking sheet that all findings have been closed.
