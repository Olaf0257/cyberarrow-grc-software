11,3.4 (a),Segmentation Penetration Test - Procedures Defined,"Penetration-testing procedures shall be defined to test all segmentation methods, to confirm they are operational and effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from systems in the CDE. "
11,3.4 (b),Segmentation Penetration Test - Segmentation Controls,"Penetration testing shall be conducted to verify segmentation controls meet the following: 
 Performed at least annually and after any changes to segmentation controls/methods. 
 Covers all segmentation controls/methods in use. 
 Verifies that segmentation methods are operational and effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from systems in the CDE."
11,3.4 (c),Segmentation Penetration Test - Qualified Vendors,"Tests shall be performed by a qualified internal resource or qualified external third party, and if applicable, does organizational independence of the tester exist (not required to be a QSA or ASV). "
11,4 (a),Implement and Use IDS/IPS,"Intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques that detect and/or prevent intrusions into the network shall be in place to monitor all traffic: 
 - At the perimeter of the cardholder data environment, and 
 - At critical points in the cardholder data environment."
11,4 (b),Implement and Use IDS/IPS - Configured for Alerting,Intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques shall be configured to alert personnel of suspected compromises. 
11,4 (c),Implement and Use IDS/IPS - Kept Up-to-Date,"All intrusion-detection and prevention engines, baselines, and signatures shall be kept up-to-date."
11,5 (a),Change Detection,"A change-detection mechanism (for example, file-integrity monitoring tools) shall be deployed to detect unauthorized modification (including changes, additions, and deletions) of critical system files, configuration files, or content files.  
 Examples of files that should be monitored include: 
 - System executables 
 - Application executables 
 - Configuration and parameter files 
 - Centrally stored, historical or archived, log, and audit files 
 - Additional critical files determined by entity (for example, through risk assessment or other means)"
11,5 (b),Change Detection - Configured to Alert,"The change-detection mechanism shall be configured to alert personnel to unauthorized modification (including changes, additions, and deletions) of critical system files, configuration files or content files, and the tools shall perform critical file comparisons at least weekly. 
Note: For change detection purposes, critical files are usually those that do not regularly change, but the modification of which could indicate a system compromise or risk of compromise. Change detection mechanisms such as file-integrity monitoring products usually come pre-configured with critical files for the related operating system. Other critical files, such as those for custom applications, must be evaluated and defined by the entity (that is the merchant or service provider)"
11,5.1,Change Detection Response,A process shall be in place to respond to any alerts generated by the change-detection solution. 
12,1,Security Policies,"A security policy shall be established, published, maintained, and disseminated to all relevant personnel. "
12,1.1,Security Policy Review,The security policy shall be reviewed at least annually and updated when the environment changes. 
12,4,Security Policies Define Responsibilities,Security policy and procedures shall be clearly define information security responsibilities for all personnel. 
12,5.3,Security Assignment - Incident Response,"Ensure establishing, documenting, and distributing security incident response and escalation procedures to make sure timely and effective handling of all situations. "

12,8.1,List of Service Providers with Access to Cardholder Data,"A list of service providers shall be maintained, including a description of the service(s) provided. "
12,8.2,Service Provider Acknowledgement,"A written agreement shall be maintained that includes an acknowledgement that the service providers are responsible for the security of cardholder data the service providers possess or otherwise store, process, or transmit on behalf of the customer, or to the extent that they could impact the security of the customer's cardholder data environment. 
 Note: The exact wording of an acknowledgement will depend on the agreement between the two parties, the details of the service being provided, and the responsibilities assigned to each party. The acknowledgement does not have to include the exact wording provided in this requirement."
12,8.3,Service Provider Engagement,"There should be an established process for engaging service providers, including proper due diligence prior to engagement."
12,8.4,Service Provider Compliance,A program shall be maintained to monitor service providers' PCI DSS compliance status at least annually.
12,8.5,Service Provider PCI Requirements Management,"Information shall be maintained about which PCI DSS requirements are managed by each service provider, and which are managed by the entity. "
12,10.1 (a),Context of Incident Response Plan,An incident response plan shall be created to be implemented in the event of system breach.
